      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve relaunched my blog after a long hiatus. The reboot gave me a chance to learn a new tool&amp;ndash;blogdown&amp;ndash;and it forced me to revisit some old posts from my former blog platform. I wrote a lot of poetry in the last couple of years, most of it sparked by various personal events. Not all of it sounds as good to me now as it did then, but I avoided the temptation to edit my past.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to move my blog to the blogdown package. I spend so much of my research life in RStudio it makes sense to move this direction.</description>
