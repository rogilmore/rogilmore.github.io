I find Andrew Sullivan worth reading almost all of the time even if I disagree with him.
This [time](https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2018/12/andrew-sullivan-establishment-will-never-say-no-to-a-war.html), I agree completely:

> "*...I simply do not believe that the West has the knowledge, the will, or the ability to shape the extremely complicated and endlessly vicious politics of the Middle East. And I defy anyone to show otherwise...*"

So, while I find the present occupant completely unfit for office, I applaud his announcement to withdraw U.S. troops from Syria and reduce our presence in Afghanistan.

We forget that *Congress* has the Constitutional power to declare war or decisively choose not to.
It's part of the balance of powers created by the Framers.
I'd like to see Congress restore balance here and in other areas.
