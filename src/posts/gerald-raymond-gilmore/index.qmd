Gerald Raymond (Jerry) Gilmore, 83, died Thanksgiving night at his home in Littleton after a satisfying feast and joyful celebration with family. Jerry worked in the Denver Public Schools from 1962 until retiring as Principal of Centennial Elementary School in 1995. A Denver native, he was first in his family to attend college (University of Denver), and the first to earn a graduate degree (University of Minnesota and the University of Wisconsin). An avid and skilled athlete, he lettered in football, basketball, and baseball all three years at North High School, and he earned a baseball scholarship to the University of Denver. In later years, he tore-up tennis courts in pick-up games at Bear Valley Park. In August of 1962, he married the love of his life, Sharon Lee (Britton) Gilmore, and they enjoyed 61 years of marriage before Jerry's death. Jerry is survived by his loving wife Shari, sons Rick Owen Gilmore and Thomas Don Gilmore, daughter-in-law Michelle Stephanie Katz, grandchildren Eleanor Brooke Gilmore and Bee Gilmore, grand son-in-law Sam Bryson-Brockmann, great-grandson, Alvin Henry (Sonny) Gilmore, sister Lela Orrino, nephews Mark Orrino, Scott Orrino, David Britton, and Kevin Britton, and nieces Donette Albrechtsen and Toni O'Connor. Contributions in Jerry's name may be made to The Action Center (<https://theactioncenter.org>), an organization he and Shari supported.
