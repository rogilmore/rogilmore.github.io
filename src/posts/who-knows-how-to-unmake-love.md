<p>Who knows how to unmake love?</br>
that fertile ground for growing</br>
goodness</br>
in tiny cracks between beings.</br>
</p>

<p><em>Passionate</em> demands attention, but draws reluctant admiration</br>
for his gymnastic stamina and</br>
singularity of focus --</br>
a laser light later scattered in time's gauze.
</p>

<p>Oh so cute I could pinch the cheeks of this <em>Puppy</em> she says <em>40 Years Married</em> now.</br>
Others applaud politely if not quite aspiring to such</br>
longevity.
</p>

<p><em>Unrequited</em> garners the requisite sympathy.</br>
Fearing the recollection in his reflection,</br>
they remark so sad to one another not him.</br>
Getting better, he gamely proclaims if asked his status.
</p>

<p><em>Of Country</em> sometimes sings at wrong moments.</br>
In his chest beat two mindhearts, one humbleproud, the other not so.
</p>

<p><em>Familial</em> says leave it alone it's complicated,</br>
but none of us can quite completely ever; let's get real, people.
</p>

<p>But, how can BOTH unwant you? asks <em>Unrequited</em> of <em>Unwanted</em></br>
trying to be sincere, sympathetic.
</p>

<p>Impossible. and yet here I am, she answers.</br>
no more able to explain her creation or illogical persistence than any other.
</p>

<p>Is it sad? Are you?</p>

<p>I think not. No.</p>

<p>We <em>Love</em> are performers in this passion play, pinacles of</br>
perfection, the</br> 
apotheosis of achievement, speaking poetically I mean.
</p>

<p>And so the slender tender shoots that sprang in that space</br>
and unfurled under unfriendly spotlight -- </br>
dangerously acknowledged if ever. and deeply unwanted</br>
speak not of them please --</br>
remain unwithered, wonderous, a blessing to behold,</br>
even if without peer or purpose.</br>
Perhaps then especially.
</p>

<p>Friendship mends the cracks in the world.</p>

<p>Who knows how to unmake love?</br>
Or even knowing would?
</p>
