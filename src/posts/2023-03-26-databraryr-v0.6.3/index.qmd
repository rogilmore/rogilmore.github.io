A new version of `databraryr` is now available on CRAN.

This version supports "piping" of commands:

```{r}
databraryr::list_volume_assets() |> 
  dplyr::filter(format_extension == "csv") |>
  databraryr::download_session_assets_fr_df()
```

These CSV files are from the default volume 1, session/slot 9807.
By default, the files are saved in the local directory named with the session ID.

So, we can do the following:

```{r}
inst_invest_df <- readr::read_csv("9807/databrary-institutions-investigators.csv",
                                  show_col_types = FALSE)

library(ggplot2)
inst_invest_df |>
  ggplot() +
  aes(x = Date, y = Institutions) +
  geom_point()
```

This is obviously an older version of the plot showing growth in the number of authorizing institutions.
The current, more colorfully styled version is here:

Supporting piping had been on my to-do list, but I pushed it up the priority list on the request of some colleagues.
