taunts of bad hair boy-men</br>
transfix the play yard.</br>
mine is bigger. no mine. look.

there is no alternative channel</br> 
for the cartoon among nations.

our smiley wiley has</br>
chased some tail</br>
feather off a cliff</br>
and stands now unbound by ground,</br>
animation suspended.</br>

'tis only a matter of time</br>
until</br>
the forces of nature</br>
overcome their shock at the effrontery</br>
and shame gravity to reassert its</br>
inevitable grasp on matter and mass.

But what then goes before the fall?</br>
This abyss extends how deep?</br>
And whose tongue flip says meep-meep?
