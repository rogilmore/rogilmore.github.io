Terrorists terrorize.</br>
They destroy and divide.</br>
They provoke reaction and compel reactionaries.</br>
They valorize violence.</br>
They corrupt compassion.</br>
They mangle meaning.</br>
They obliterate order and sunder sanity.</br>
They choose chaos.</br>
They prevent peace.

We must choose differently.</br>
Or join them in that void from which no light escapes.
