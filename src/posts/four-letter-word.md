<p>I strangled hope.</br>
Smug bastard annoyed me.</br>
I spring eternal; there is always room for me,</br> 
he'd say</br>
(or his fanboys would moonily recite).</br>
So I grabbed his throat</br>
and fingers clenched squeezed.</br>
his eyes bulged green</br>
then withered gray.</br>
he lay dishrag limp on my lap.</br>
I hissed a firehose sigh,</br>
a contrail marking passage across some cloudless sky</br>
and felt</br>
don't laugh</br>
full of...</p>

<p>Persistent bastard.</br>
Kill you again if I have the chance.</br>
Maybe tomorrow.
</p>
