Some rascal or rogue</br>
Stashed kryptonite</br>
Upon my person.

Perhaps in that fingertip pocket of my Levi’s,</br>
Or the underside of the spare button on that green and black plaid shirt,</br>
Or the tunnel in my underwear that no man uses I assure you but most boys try at least once.</br>

I have always loved flying</br>
And nerdy girls.</br>
I have been underestimated by villains,</br>
And see beneath the surfaces of things.</br>
I’m unusually attentive to phone booths,</br>
And of course capes.

It’s just when I tried to catch bullets</br>
Lois changed lanes.</br>
And I needed the horn rims to see up from down</br>
When forced to discover that</br>
the laws of gravity</br>
Are never broken.
