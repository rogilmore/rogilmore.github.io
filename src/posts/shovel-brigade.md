a long-term symptom of this peculiar viral infection</br>
is loss of smell.</br>

yet bullshit</br>

spewn from a particular asshole</br>

smells</br>
like victory...</br>
heady, sweet...</br>

the sort dogs wallow in</br>
rolling back and forth and forth and back</br>
tongues wagging</br>
in mysterious ecstasy,</br>
dreaming of greatness.</br>

but the writhing celebration invokes consternation and</br> 
unrare cursing among loved ones and neighbors</br>
to whom</br>
turd is turd</br>
not holy word.</br>

infectious? oh my yes.</br>
and deadly.</br>
eludes standard treatments,</br>
and won't succumb soon.</br>

no vaccine known to science will make this herd immune.</br>

rather place hope in the shovel brigade.</br>
they follow the elephant</br>
scooping up the stinking piles,</br>
hauling them elsewhere to decompose.</br>
Heroes these.</br>

Still, the stench lingers and there, a stain.</br>
a reminder that there is much to mourn</br>
and more to bury</br>
deep, soon,</br>

before the next wave crests.
