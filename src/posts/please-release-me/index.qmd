I am pleased to announce that the `databraryr` has been [released](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/databraryr/index.html) on the Comprehensive R Archive Network ([CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org)).

According to [GitHub](https://github.com/databrary/databraryr), I started this back in 2018.
It was a way to learn about Databrary, learn about interacting with application program interfaces (APIs) in general, and improve my R programming chops.
The package has become extremely useful to me.
It's essential to the Databrary [analytics site](https://databrary.github.io/analytics) and to the PLAY Project's [KoBoToolbox workflow](https://PLAY-behaviorome.github.io/KoBoToolbox).
I hope that others can say the same eventually.

Thanks to Jeff Spies for his help getting this over the final hurdles in the review process.
And thanks to the CRAN reviewers for their help resolving some last minute bugs.

Now, on to the Python version!
