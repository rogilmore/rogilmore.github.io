The outstanding team at [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org) has an interactive graphic showing the results of a recent survey about who would be willing to contribute 1% of their income to tackle climate change vs. the perceived proportion of the population in the respondents' home countries that they predict would be willing to make such a commitment.

There are many interesting insights, including which countries are most committed to making changes.
But universally, more people say they personally would contribute than predict that others would do likewise.
