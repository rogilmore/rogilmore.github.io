I woke up insanely early this morning. 
Of all things, I decided that it was time to update my blog. 
Little did I realize that it had been more than a year since I'd touched it!
Thank goodness the code still ran, and that I hadn't completely forgotten how to update the site.

There are many new things to write about--new projects, new poems.
My pre-2023 resolution is to use the blog as a vehicle for doing just that.
Seems like a fitting way to wrap-up a "stay"-battical.
