Last night I had the delight of announcing a partnership between Cub Scout Pack 67 and the [Nittany Amateur Radio Club (NARC)](https://nittany-arc.org).
We're collaborating to participate in the international Jamboree on the Air (JOTA) for Scouts of all ages.

The plan is to set-up a station at Circleville Park outside of State College on Saturday, October 21, 2023.
Propagation permitting, we'll make contacts with Scout groups and other hams all over North America and perhaps into Europe.
We've even secured a 1x1 special event callsign for this activity: [K3C](https://qrz.com/db/k3c/).
W3EDP and K3YV are my partners in organizing the event.

Last year's event fell victim to COVID, so we're very excited to get a second go.
K3YV will bring his go-box featuring the Yaesu FT-891 for HF work.
We'll also try connecting to my Allstar node (51401).

If you're a ham or Scout group, please try to make contact.
We should be active from about 1400 - 1700 UTC.

And if you have any thoughts on how to capture and package the energy of 5 to 10 year-olds, let me know.
There are days when a little extra kick would come in handy.
