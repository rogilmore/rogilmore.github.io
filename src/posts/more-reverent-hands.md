Many in curiosity, some in urgency,</br>
seek secret signs in corners dark and cold, </br>
red and brown,</br> 
in rock, or ice, or vapor.</br>

The distances astound;</br>
the technologies delight;</br>
the vistas inspire.</br>
And yet our seeking has yet to find.</br>

Contrary news may yet arrive,</br>
astonishing all,
tomorrow</br>
or never.</br>

Still now, and for unknown ages to come,</br> 
and everywhere here, </br>
and nowhere else we know of yet, </br>
there is life.</br>

There is life</br>
in forms yet unseen</br>
in places unvisited,</br>
thriving in blessed, bursting abundance.</br>

Here, we are not alone.</br>

We are, in our oneness, multitudes.</br>
We are children of eons, </br>
parents of tomorrow,</br>
and cousins of all.</br>

But there, in the dark and empty, </br>
there is no one, and no thing, and no where.</br>
Nowhere like here.</br>

You see, we never left Eden.</br>

The apple did not open an ignorant mind</br>
but closed it to wonder.</br>

In shedding innocence we forgot</br>

...that our Earthly garden,</br> 
swims in silence through a void vast,</br> 
odorless and monochrome;</br>

...that the only paradise we have ever known </br>
or truly needed,</br>
is ours,</br>
and ours alone,</br>
to tend.</br>

What might we might grow with more reverent hands?
