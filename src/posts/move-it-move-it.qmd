Ok, so this is not an especially thoughtful post.
Its purpose is to test video embedding, test some text animations using the [Animate.css](https://github.com/mcanouil/quarto-animate) extension, and test the `quarto-webr` [extension](https://quarto-webr.thecoatlessprofessor.com).

Does {{< animate bounce "this text" >}} move?

Let's hope so.

## {{< animate rubberBand "Rubber band" >}} header

Did the title snap to?
I think so.
Ok, now I know how to do this.

The [animate.style](https://animate.style) site provides more information.

## Let's try some webr

<https://quarto-webr.thecoatlessprofessor.com>

```{webr-r}
fit = lm(mpg ~ am, data = mtcars)
summary(fit)
```

I have tried all of the troubleshooting tips on <https://quarto-webr.thecoatlessprofessor.com/qwebr-troubleshooting.html> but have not resolved the problem.

I'm going to leave this here to sort-out later.
