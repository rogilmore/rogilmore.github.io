Mother Earth</br>
loves her children like no other.</br>
She pulls us close--</br>
an attraction lawful.</br>
No mass within her orbit</br>
resists the pull.</br>

She is unmoved</br>
by leaps of faith.</br>
Flights of fancy or physics all land or crash.</br>
And every passenger</br>
in time must find</br>
some solace silent</br>
buried in her bosom.</br>
