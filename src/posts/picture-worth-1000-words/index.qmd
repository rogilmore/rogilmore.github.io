Music lovers of my generation remember that phrase at the lyrics of a song by the group Bread.
The phrase is one of those constructive memes that my colleague, Karen Adolph and I have extended to highlight the even *more* informative power of video--10,000 pictures!

This post doesn't feature any video.
But it does demonstrate a new tool embedded within [Quarto](https://quarto.org) that I expect to make use of frequently, scriptable [diagrams](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/diagrams.html) using [*Mermaid*](http://mermaid.js.org) and *Graphviz*.

Here's a simple one using Mermaid lightly modified from the project site.

```{mermaid}
graph TD;
    A-->B;
    A-->C;
    B-->D;
    C-->D;
    D-->A;
```

And here's a second one, closer to my heart, with some formatting:

```{mermaid}
%%| fig-cap: "State spaces and causal pathways in cognition"
%%| fig-align: "center"
flowchart TD
  N[Nervous system] --> B(Body)
  B --> W{World}
  W --> B
  B --> N
  N --> N
  B --> B
  W --> W
```

I sketch graphs like this all the time, so having support for tools like Mermaid and Graphviz built-in to Quarto should help me depict my ideas, at least some of them, in fewer words.

Of course, now I need to learn more about Mermaid (and refresh my memory about Graphviz).
