Dear Friends,</br>
</br>
It is the ache</br>
and honor</br>
of those you</br>
have touched</br>
</br>
to join you uninvited</br>
</br>
to fathom the unfathomable</br>
to grieve the grievous</br>
</br>
to go where none</br>
would ever choose</br>
except thrust by must.</br>
</br>
And so we</br>
sit and stand</br>
sit and stand</br>
pray and question prayer</br>
moan and mumble</br>
weep and wonder</br>
</br>
in love and sorrow</br>
in longing</br>
and in light</br>
</br>
with you.
