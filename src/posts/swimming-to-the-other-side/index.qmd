Folk singer Pat Humphries wrote a song called "Swimming to the Other Side" that has been covered by many other artists. Here's a link to the lyrics: <https://emmasrevolution.com/track/1288812/swimming-to-the-other-side> in case you don't know it.
Two experiences this weekend reminded me of this song's timeless and vital message.

The first was the [Greenwood Furnace Folk Gathering](https://folkgathering.com/) held at nearby Greenwood Furnace State Park.
Michelle and I enjoyed the workshops, conversations, and folk jams as we have for many years.
I even played my first blues solo on the harmonica, thanks to the encouragement of master performer and master teacher, Richard Sleigh.
The concert that evening under a well-aged tent in the middle of a heavy rainstorm showed just how much we depend on one another, for entertainment, fellowship, comfort, safety, and joy.

>In humility I will listen</br>
>We’re all swimming to the other side.

The second experience was at the grand opening of a new community centre in downtown State College for the LGBTQ+ community.
Michelle was one of two musicians to be invited to perform.
These are especially difficult times for members of the LGBTQ+ community in the U.S., so it was gratifying to appreciate first-hand what the center's opening means to this group of marginalized friends, family, and colleagues.
As Humphrey's song says:

>Loving spirits will live together</br>
>We’re all swimming to the other side
