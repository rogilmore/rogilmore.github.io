Earlier in the summer, I tried to make a hex sticker for the [Open Science Bootcamp](https://penn-state-open-science.github.io/bootcamp-2023).

One of my inspirations was this post from the R bloggers site:

<https://www.r-bloggers.com/2023/06/how-to-generate-a-hex-sticker-with-openai-and-cropcircles/?utm_source=phpList&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=R-bloggers-daily&utm_content=HTML>

So, I entered the terms "open transparent reproducible science" into the AI, and it came back with this image:

We didn't like it much, so we ended up using a word cloud as a poor man's substitute.

In digging a little deeper though, I found the *hexSticker* package (<https://github.com/GuangchuangYu/hexSticker>).

Every self-respecting computer-person has to have a collection of hex stickers, right?
Ok, so I confess that I do not put stickers on my laptop.
I'm one of those folks who likes the sleek metalic look of my laptop to remain, well sleek and metalic.
But I recognize a popular trend when I see one.
So here, mostly to document where and how to do it, is some code to make a simple hex sticker.
It draws heavily on the how-tos from the *hexSticker* GitHub site.

```{r}
library(hexSticker)

hexSticker::sticker(
  "play-leaf.png",
  package = "PLAY",
  p_size = 35,
  p_color = "#5C8C5C",
  h_fill ="#FFFFFF",
  h_color = "#5C8C5C",
  s_x = 1,
  s_y = .8,
  s_width = .40,
  filename = "play-hex.png"
)
```

There are a lot of parameters to play with to make this look good.
But this is a start.
Go forth and make stickers.
