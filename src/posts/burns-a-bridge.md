burns a bridge</br>
the night long, this heat</br>
retards bitterness and cold</br>
yellow-red flickers illuminate, but dimly</br>
even in that moment fleeting</br>
but wonders he later</br>
wherefore the stench</br>
and who has shut the road</br>
again.

we do not swim.

in motion emotion forever</br>
forward</br>
fresh, frenetic,</br>
pushed by what</br>
i know not</br>
pulled more like</br>
perhaps by gravitational force</br>
or some repulsion.</br>
the formula admits no closed form solution.</br>

ash & ember</br>
linger in their dull glow.</br>
fire can cauterize, staunch, and save the wounded,</br>
but also sear</br>
the mortal flesh,</br>
branding innocents,</br>
and in smoky shadows scar–</br>
spreading jumble-tumbles of silent speaking symbols–</br>
others inspect for structure or sense</br>
and in failing ask</br>
why
