The tools of the do-it-yourself surgeon vary in sharpness.</br>
Some glint in just that light,</br>
and cut in their fashion,</br>
but how deeply</br>
or cleanly</br>
only the scar will tell.</br>

And it surprises,</br>
the ooze I mean,</br>
and yes, the stench.</br>
Is that me?</br>
I expected something more or perhaps different from the excavation of this interior.

Worse,</br>
once extracted</br>
not all the </br>
giblets fit back into the cavity.</br>
What to do about the extra bits?</br>
There really is no suitable stewpot.</br>

Of course, the news stays private,</br>
so no flowers adorn the recuperation.</br>

If there is a next time, it may be best to seek a second opinion</br>
or a Highlands malt, cask-aged and served neat.</br>
Leave the scalpel on the tray.</br>
