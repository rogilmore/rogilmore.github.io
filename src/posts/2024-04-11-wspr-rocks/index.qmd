![Weak Signal Propagation Reporter (WSPR) spots on 20m during the 2024-04-08 eclipse](w3tm-2024-04-08-20m.png)

I ran my Flex 6400 at low power (5 W) to generate propagation data for the [HamSCI](https://hamsci.org) project during the 2024-04-08 total eclipse.
The WSJT-X program generated the signals.
With the SmartSDR iOS and MacOS apps and Google Remote Desktop, I was able to monitor the station and control it remotely.

The radio telescope did not get built in time.
Nor did I participate in the [Solar Eclipse QSO Party](https://hamsci.org/seqp-rules).

It's fun to see just how far a decent antenna--my end-fed half-wave (EFHW)--got out with only 5 W.
And I'll look forward to the report about how the eclipse affected the ionosphere.

As the website itself claims, [wspr.rocks](http://wspr.rocks)!
