<p>like surfing a comet</p>

<p>in such a frictionless state</br>
we are thought experiments in</br>
Schrodinger's sanctuary,</br>
simultaneously alive and dead, both and neither,</br> 
statistically speaking.</br>
let us out of the box to end the mystery;</br> 
measure our true state at your peril and ours.</p>

<p>novices idealize its positions, velocities,</br>
accelerations of different centers of mass.</br>
meanwhile the conservation of momentum,</br>
the history of trajectories of particles in collision,</br>
demonstrates the superiority of this calculus over that algebra.</p>

<p>thermodynamics describes expanding heat, rising</br>
but then entropy, entropy, entropy.</p>

<p>electrodynamics binds the electric and magnetic</br>
through which polar opposites make sparks fly.</p>

<p>the strong nuclear force, with its companion forces bind mortal</br>
matter</br>
but what of orbits around her sun -- </br>
so many planets rocky, major and minor alike --</br> 
or the satellites, some perhaps hospitable to life.</br>
i'll run rings around ya, fella. and leave a glittering spray in passing.</p>

<p>to me this is all ten dimensional string theory. what else</br>
could unify</br>
Cupid's quantum and classical mechanics?</br>
really, Einstein, what could create the</br>
a black hole at the center of my galaxy,</br>
the really big bang</br>
whose aftermath leaves a telltale trail</br>
of radiation across the background of your unknown universe?</br>
what else could warp spacetime across years of light</br>
and darkness?</p>

<p>she is our specific gravity without which we'd fly hurtling off</br>
into space.</p>

<p>a quantity neither created nor destroyed</br>
Just try to measure. There are no units.</p>
