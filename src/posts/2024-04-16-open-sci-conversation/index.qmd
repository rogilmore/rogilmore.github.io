My department's clinical area invited me to [present in PSY 543, Clinical Research Methods](https://github.com/psu-psychology/psy-543-clinical-research-methods-2024) on open science.
I gratefully accepted.
We have a strong clinical program, and I enjoy engaging with the students.
Today was no exception.

Today was exceptional, however, in that all seven students said "Yes, a significant crisis" when asked if there is a reproducibility crisis in science, a question asked by a 2016 *Nature* survey [@Baker2016-rz] that I like to use as a starting point for a conversation on these topics.
Whether that's good or bad depends on your point of view, I suppose.
Of course, I agree with the endorsement, and think that recognizing a problem is the first essential step to devising solutions.

Less notable, but no less fun was a successful experiment with a new Reveal.js trick ([multiplex ](https://quarto.org/docs/presentations/revealjs/presenting.html#multiplex)) that lets the audience watch the slides advance as I advance them.

The talk was also a good excuse to review some of the recent results from the Pew Research Center surveys on trust in science and support for public funding of research [@Kennedy2023-nb].
It's not clear that these patterns reflect recent issues of reproducibility, but that's all the more reason researchers must get out in front of these issues.
