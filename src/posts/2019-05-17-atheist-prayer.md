we fear the people who love their guns</br>
more than we love our children.

the atheist prays every day to gods she finds incomprehensible:</br>

Remove the sticks of destruction</br>
from our arsenals and minds.</br>
Banish them to eternity.</br>
Cleanse us that we may be clean.

a merciful god would hear this supplicant,</br>
know her grace, </br>
and answer in the affirmative.</br>
a god who loved his children</br>
would, she thinks and hopes.</br>

but we could surely find other ways of killing, you object.

yes, I acknowledge,</br>

or perhaps</br>
just perhaps</br>
choose not to.</br>
