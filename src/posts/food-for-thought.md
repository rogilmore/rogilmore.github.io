yes she cranked the handle</br>
but the meat and potato man put his heart in the grinder</br>
and no one saved the pink spaghetti strands for chili.</br>

he could have had his cake and eaten humble pie</br> 
or worn it as a badge of honorable intent.</br>
instead he tasted just desserts that fate sandwiched</br> 
between margaritaville and a cheeseburger in paradise.

full of gumption Forest's mother disparaged the integrity of chocolates.</br>

You're more likely to find a happy meal in strawberry or key lime -- sweetness</br>
that don't need no rhyme.</br>
Eden Earth yields galactically good fruit.</br> 
(Kpax swallowed it rind and all.)</br>
Eve murmurs amen, and knowing smilingly says</br>
bone appetite my cherry.</br>
Be my eye's apple.</br>
I'll be the salt of your Earth.
