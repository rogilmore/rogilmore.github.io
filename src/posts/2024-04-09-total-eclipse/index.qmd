Michelle and I drove to Kane, PA Sunday night, then on to Ashtabula, OH for the eclipse.

We left early Sunday and took a meandering route to Kane through the backwoods of Pennsylvania.
Our original plan was to find a place somewhere south of Erie, but the weather forecast looked questionable.
So, armed with hyper-local cloud forecasts from the [Astrospheric app](https://www.astrospheric.com/?Latitude=40.862623264101586&Longitude=-77.82575988770424&Loc=Forecast), we decided to drive west until noon, then decide.
We arrived in Ashtabula by noontime, and there we actually saw the sun.
Ducking into a park by Lake Erie, we found one of the last parking spots.
It was a short walk to lunch, and then back again to await the celestial festivities.

Here are some pics from the trip:

Others have written about the unique experience totality represents.
I'd seen a partial eclipse in Denver as a high school student, so the twinkly light preceding it was familiar.
But totality was awesome in the fullest sense of that word.
Time stopped, and a ring of fire replaced the sun we too easily take for granted.
Lost in the reverie, I nearly forgot to remove the sun filter from my Seestar S50.
But I did remove it, just in time to capture a single photo:
A small token to help me remember what I hope others have a chance to see at least once.

As John McCutcheon [sings](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwTvIlXnKxo), "everybody needs something bigger than themselves; we *need* to belong to something bigger than ourselves."
