Pandemics aren't funny.</br>
Sure, people still chuckle.</br>
There are jokes.</br>
Some are almost good.

But the news novacaines my brain.</br>
I am desperate to let go some glorious, gawdawful guffaw</br>
that for one niggling nanosecond negates the numbness.

Yes, those folks really did</br>
say that all the people dying were</br>
sick and old (or from Pittsburgh and Philly).

I heard them and wanted to recite the be-attitudes.</br>
But it's ridiculous for atheists to</br>
quote the Bible.</br>
And I don't think these ghouls give a flying fig what Jesus would do</br>
no matter what they tell the pastor on Sunday morning.

Why did the chicken cross the road?</br>
He wasn't sure,</br>
but at this point in quarantine, he'd do anything to avoid another Zoom call.</br>
