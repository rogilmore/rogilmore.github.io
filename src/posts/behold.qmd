Behold...
Yesterday</br>
I touched tomorrow.

A little sir named Sonny,</br>
for he with no son,</br>
sporting a surname nearly spent.

We are all sons</br>
And daughters</br>
of daughters and sons,</br>
And cousins of some degree.

Our goings and comings</br>
Must befuddle the immortal.

Joanie fades; Henry arrives; Doris lives on in memory.</br> 
Tears escape bondage</br>
At hellos and goodbyes.</br>
Legacy begets promise.

So, my cousin</br>
Let us honor custom.</br>
Let us weep and welcome,</br>
Grieve and greet,</br>
Recall and receive.

Behold these blessings:</br>
The memory of before</br>
And the joy of now.</br>
