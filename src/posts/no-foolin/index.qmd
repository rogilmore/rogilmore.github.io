I have a new talk I call "No foolin': May all our crises be 'good' ones".
It's a new take on familiar topics.
This time, I decided to tell a story about how the reproducibility crisis sparked considerable soul-searching, but ultimately led to some concrete and specific outcomes that I am proud of.
Richard Feynmann's graduation speech to CalTech grads in 1974 [@Feynman1974-ld] figures prominently, hence the photo.

Here are the talk slides:
