One stats class was required in my grad program, and Mike Meyer was my professor.
The class was in [S-plus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S-PLUS), the closed source inspiration for R.
And Mike regularly exhorted us (in his inimitable Australian accent), "Plot your data!"

Mike's encouragment to use S-plus made it easier for me to adopt R when it appeared on the scene a few years later.
Or at least I had fewer habits to change.
And, Mike's advice about plotting your data *first* always made sense to me.
If you can't see a pattern in the plots, how can you believe the inferential statistics?

In that spirit, mostly so that I can find it again, is an outstanding demonstration of that truth, the [`datasauRus`](https://cran.r-project.org/package=datasauRus) package, based on Anscombe's quartet [@anscombe-1973], which is also available as the [`anscombe`](https://cran.r-project.org/package=anscombe) package.

```{r, fig.cap="DatasauRus figures"}
library("ggplot2")
library("datasauRus")
ggplot(datasaurus_dozen, aes(x = x, y = y, colour = dataset))+
  geom_point() +
  theme_void() +
  theme(legend.position = "none")+
  facet_wrap(~dataset, ncol = 3)
```

These all have roughly the same summary statistics.

```{r}
if(requireNamespace("dplyr")){
  suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(dplyr))
  datasaurus_dozen %>% 
    group_by(dataset) %>% 
    summarize(
      mean_x    = mean(x),
      mean_y    = mean(y),
      std_dev_x = sd(x),
      std_dev_y = sd(y),
      corr_x_y  = cor(x, y)
    )
}
```

And here are the originals from [@anscombe-1973]:

```{r}
with(anscombe, plot(x1, y1))
with(anscombe, plot(x2, y2))
with(anscombe, plot(x3, y3))
with(anscombe, plot(x4, y4))
```

Thanks for giving me such a great start in statistics, Mike! I'm sure if the Datasaurus had been around then, you'd have been a fan.
