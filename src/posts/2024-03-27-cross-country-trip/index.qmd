![Bear likes the driver's seat.](bear.jpeg)

Tom, Bear, and I drove cross-country in a U-Haul this past weekend.
Our first night was spent in Topeka.
Our second was in Dayton.
Then it was a short-ish haul on in to Happy Valley.

We had good weather and no mechanical problems.
Given that we were driving a vehicle 50' in length, it was a surprisingly quick and pleasant trip.

Tom's dog Bear was a great traveler, and was obviously a truck driver in a previous life.
Eastern Kansas is quite beautiful.
I-70 through Indiana is in disgraceful condition.
And crossing the Pennsylvania line felt like coming home.

Everyone American should drive across country at least once.
But I've now done it multiple times, and I'm ready to check it off the list.
