Today is a workshop on "Good enough data and project management practices."
I'm delighted to be a member of a team that is bringing these ideas to a wider audience here at Penn State.
This effort is part of a broader initiative on open scholarship that a number of us have been working to promote.

Here is the workshop [website](https://penn-state-open-science/data-mgmt-2024).
