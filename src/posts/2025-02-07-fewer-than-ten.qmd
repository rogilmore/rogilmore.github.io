According to NCAA officials, there are fewer than 10 transgender athletes among
more than 510,000 collegiate athletes in the U.S.

I just don't believe people who think that banning transgender athletes from competition has ~~anything~~ very much to do with fairness in sport.

## Data story visualization

In the spirit of my [Spring 2025 class on data visualization](https://psu-psychology.github.io/psych-490-data-viz-2025-spring), here is a simple visualization of these data.

```{r}
#| label: fig-visualize-transgender-ncaa
#| fig-caption: "Transgender vs. non-transgender athletes in the NCAA."

suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(ggplot2))

gender <- data.frame(gender = c("non-transgender", "transgender"), athletes = c(510000, 10))

gender |>
  ggplot() +
  aes(x = gender, y = athletes) +
  geom_col() +
  ylab("NCAA athletes") +
  theme_classic()
```

It's hard to see a tiny stand of trees amidst a vast forest, isn't it?
