<p>sweet land of liberty of thee i sing</p>

<p>the world will little note, nor long remember what we say here,</br>
but it can never forget what they did:</br>
unreasonable searches and seizures</br>
deprived of life, liberty, or property without due process.</p>

<p>o say can you see by the dawn's early light</br>
that a house divided against itself cannot stand;</br>
that bravura is not bravery.</p>

<p>this land is your land, this land is my land.</p>

<p>we here highly resolve that</br>
these dead shall not have died in vain</p>

<p>for</p>

<p>we, the people, do ordain and establish</br>
that all men are created equal;</br>
that they are endowed by their creator with</br> 
certain</br>
inalienable</br> 
rights,</p>

<p>among these are life,</br>
nor cruel and unusual punishments inflicted.</p>

<p>land of the pilgrims' pride</br>
in order to form a more perfect union,</br>
establish justice,</br>
let freedom ring,</br>
secure the blessings of liberty,</br>
promote the general welfare.</p>

<p>for amber waves of grain God shed his grace on thee,</br>
ourselves and our posterity -- </br>
your huddled masses yearning to breathe</br>
free.

<p>we hold these truths to be self-evident:</br>
the rule of fear subverts the rule of law.</br>
we do these things not because they are easy, but because they are hard.</p>

<p>i have a dream.</p>
