On a lark I decided to grab the W3TM.org domain.
W3TM.com wasn't available.
I think I know why, but the truth is, I prefer a dot-org domain for this sort of thing.
That spurred me to move my ham radio website to <https://w3tm.org>.

Now, a new ham radio blog, my [shack](https://w3tm.org/shack) operating guide, and the in-progress [*New Ham Book*](https://w3tm.org/new-ham-book) have a home under that domain.
GitHub pages makes it easy-peasy.

And, of course, [Quarto](https://quarto.org) is the engine.
If I could only figure out how to get it to cook dinner.
