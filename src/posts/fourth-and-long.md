<p>sometimes late in the 4th quarter</br>
you're down a score,</br>
out of timeouts,</br>
and it's 4th and long.</p>

<p>on the line is your whole season</p>

<p>or your job</p>

<p>or your life.</p>

<p>and you throw the Hail Mary</br>
toward that one corner of the endzone</br>
where your receivers just might beat the cornerbacks</br>
in a jump ball</br>
or a volleyball tip,</br>
and two feet just might land in bounds,</br>
and the crowd just might roar,</br>
and you just might reach to the sky in triumph,</br>
and your tears just might be ones of joy.</p>

<p>coach always said you play your heart out until the whistle.</br>
on each and every down.</br>
until the final one.</p>

<p>leave it all on the field.</br>
that's what champions do.</br>
even when they lose.</p>
