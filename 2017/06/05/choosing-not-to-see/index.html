      <p>One of my fellow ham radio operators wryly thanked Al Gore for yesterday&rsquo;s unusually code and wet weather.</p>

<p>Setting aside climate politics for a moment, let&rsquo;s look at the <a href="http://www.usclimatedata.com/climate/state-college/pennsylvania/united-states/uspa2543">data</a>. See the big blue bar centered on June? It&rsquo;s typically our rainiest month. I have to remind myself of this every one of the 20 odd years we&rsquo;ve lived here. Junes are rainy. Get over it. The <a href="http://www.usclimatedata.com/climate/state-college/pennsylvania/united-states/uspa2543">average lows and highs</a> are 59 deg and 78 deg, respectfully. So, yesterday&rsquo;s high of 61 deg and low of 48 deg was on the chilly side.  But, given all the weather weirdness we&rsquo;ve experienced both this year and over the past several, it&rsquo;s not really that unusual.</p>

<p>My friend seems to have forgotten (conveniently) the lovely 73 deg temperatures we enjoyed in <strong>late February</strong>:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.timeanddate.com/weather/usa/state-college/historic?month=2&year=2017">
<img src="../../../../images/weather-state-college-2017-02.jpg"/>
</a></p>

<p>Now, those <em>really were</em> unusual temperatures for this part of the globe at that time of year. But, of course, that&rsquo;s really the point. The term &ldquo;global warming&rdquo; refers to an average warming <em>across the entire globe.</em> No one paying even the slightest attention can fail to have noticed how much milder winters here in Pennsylvania have become&hellip;on average. Some wags have even said we should call it &ldquo;global weirding&rdquo; because lots of us will experience &lsquo;weird&rsquo; weather more often. And that unpredictability is just what one would expect from changing the parameters of a non-linear dynamical system like the climate.</p>

<p>Good hams (I&rsquo;m not one yet) pay a lot of attention to how solar conditions, weather, affect DX (long distance radio wave) propagation. And the answers are probabilistic, just like weather forecasting and climatology. The propagation on some days defies the longer term (largely unfavorable, sunspot mediated) trend. That doesn&rsquo;t mean physics has taken a holiday.</p>

<p>So, yes, I do thank Al Gore for having the courage to speak inconvenient truths that far too many of us simply choose not to see. The climate is warming overall, despite some suprisingly chilly (but typically rainy) weather in June. I hope my ham friend and others will eventually stop treating climate science differently from other fields they know more about. I hope that more <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/04/us/education-climate-change-science-class-students.html">teachers like Mr. Sutter</a> take up the good fight.</p>

<p>And for what it&rsquo;s worth, I hope this particular point on the globe keeps below-average summer temperatures for a bit longer. I like cooler temperatures.</p>
