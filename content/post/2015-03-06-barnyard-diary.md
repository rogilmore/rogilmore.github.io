<p>Feeling sheepish?</br>
You try wearing wool in July.
</p>

Ya think I'd chew this stuff if I could smoke it?

Hey, lady, let me juice *yours*.

<p>I'm past waiting for some sweet-talking spider</br>
to say I'm super.
</p>

<p>The horse is an ass.</br>
Aren't they all?
</p>

<p>I don't relish rooster's cock 'em who'll do</br>
any more than you two.</br>
You see, cherie, he crows he wants to do me.
</p>

If I could sleep in a bed, I wouldn't roll in the hay.
