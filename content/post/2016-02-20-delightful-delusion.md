oh my, yes.</br>
I oh so wanted to see</br>
a tuxedo, penguin crisp, satin shiny,</br>
pseudo-sparkle when he sauntered by</br>
us peons, clinging to</br>
such rags as misfortune</br>
left in her cloud of dust and tears.</br>
Coughing.

but, oh my no. no.</br>
Clad there not in finery,</br>
but in the simplest of suits.</br>
Birthday I am told the style.</br>
Flattered, but not flattering.</br>
Scoffing, not coughing.

And in seeing I could not unsee,</br>
despite I swear so wanting, you must believe,</br>
Nor in knowing could I unknow</br>
what what wisdom bears in its stoop and beard</br>
the penultimate emptiness of every emperor,</br>
penguin or man.</br>

It's delightful, this delusion of guardian garments.</br>
I'll just close my eyes.
