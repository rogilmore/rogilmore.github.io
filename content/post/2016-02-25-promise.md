<p>I flare my talons</br>
and prepare to strike,</br>
but only in defense.</br>
I sharpen my beak, but only in warning.</p>

<p>I am your presidential detail,</br>
your Secret Service.</br>
Vigilant. Committed.</br>
I seek out bullets fired in your direction</br>
by indifferent snipers</br>
and absorb their impact with joy.</br>
Unwounded.</p>

<p>I will carry your heart when it cannot be lifted.</br>
I will find you when you are lost even to yourself.</br>
I will light your darkness with the fire in my eyes,</br>
and we will crawl together out of the wilderness.</br>
I will gather each and every scattered scrap of your shattered heart</br>
and bind them all with stitches</br>
from the unbreakable thread of my love.</p>
