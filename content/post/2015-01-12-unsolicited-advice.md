<p>My unicorn</br>
Is patron saint of regret.</br>
He holds dominion over</br>
Things wished-for but not received.</br>
the unfulfilled, unrequited, unrealized.</p>

<p>Get it? He says, I'm like a Magritte or an Escher. Self-referential.</p>

<p>I don't. Or, I do, but I'm wallowing.</p>

<p>Quite unselfservingly,</br>
He says I should</br>
shun the vaporous un....</br>
and rather mind those things I got</br>
but did not think to wish for.</p>

<p>Treasure there, matey -- </br>
Forges to steel the metal in yer mettle;</br>
(He's fond of pirate talk, too. Who knew?)</br>
Jewels to find and mine and polish;</br>
And critters to craft your character--</br>
Gollums surely, but a perhaps Samwise or maybe Gandalf.</br>
Who wouldn't find a wizard handy in tight spots?</p>

<p>Or a unicorn, I say.</p>

<p>He just stares. Is that a snort?</p>

<p>Oh, and cherish, but don't count your blessings. They come in different sizes.</p>
