<p>there's an elephant in this room.</br>
i like them, usually,</br>
but this one has her trunk in myâ€¦</p>

<p>you don't see it?</br>
but, there's hardly room to breathe,</br>
and then of course the smell.<p>

<p>be careful where you step.</p>

<p>i don't know how it got here.</br>
they start small like everything else.</br>
slip in your back pocket or </br>
through the eye of the needle blindly following some stupid camel or </br>
summoned by incantations like this unsaid that.</p>

<p>no, this is different from the 800 pound gorilla.</br>
don't patronize me.</p>

<p>just wait until a barrel foot steps on _your_ toes</br>
then, i think we'll talk.</br>

<p>have a peanut?</p>
