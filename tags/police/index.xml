      <description>I got into an argument with my father two years ago over a blog post I wrote in the midst of an epidemic of police killings of unarmed black men. The recent events at Standing Rock, where my daughter Deb and her friends currently reside, have bearing on our disagreement.
My dad believes that civilians should obey police orders, and that those who do not put themselves at grave risk. I agree that disobeying police orders can put civilians in jeopardy.</description>
