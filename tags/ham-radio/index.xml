      <description>One of my fellow ham radio operators wryly thanked Al Gore for yesterday&amp;rsquo;s unusually code and wet weather.
Setting aside climate politics for a moment, let&amp;rsquo;s look at the data. See the big blue bar centered on June? It&amp;rsquo;s typically our rainiest month. I have to remind myself of this every one of the 20 odd years we&amp;rsquo;ve lived here. Junes are rainy. Get over it. The average lows and highs are 59 deg and 78 deg, respectfully.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve wanted to be an amateur radio operator since I was a little kid and read about the hobby in Boys&amp;rsquo; Life magazine. As a high schooler, I scraped together the pennies to buy a shortwave radio receiver, a Yaesu FRG-7, and with a long wire I ran up to the roof of my parents&amp;rsquo; house, I listened to the world. Catching the English language broadcast of Radio Tirana from Albania was a memorable highlight.</description>
