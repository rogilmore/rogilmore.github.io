      <p>Must we fight the Civil War again?</p>

<p>That is the fundamental question that this hour of history poses for us to answer.</p>

<p>That is the question raised by the continued popularity of the Confederate flag and the reverence shown to it.</p>

<p>That is the question raised when the people&rsquo;s armed representatives, officers of the peace, kill brown people again and again and again and again without punishment.</p>

<p>That is the question when neighbors, friends, and loved ones are slaughtered merely because they love differently.</p>

<p>That is the question when we damn an entire religion for the actions of a tiny fraction of its adherents.</p>

<p>Lincoln said &ldquo;A house divided against itself cannot stand.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Our house is deeply divided. On that we must all surely agree.</p>

<p>How long can it stand?</p>

<p>Surveying the carnage at Gettysburg, Lincoln observed that &ldquo;Now, we are engaged in a great civil war testing whether that Nation, or any Nation, so conceived and so dedicated can long endure.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Our streets are now battlefields.</p>

<p>How long can a Nation dedicated to the proposition that all men and women are created equal endure battle after battle after battle that lays bare the untruth of that aspiration?</p>

<p>Must we fight a Civil War again?</p>

<p>Let there be no misunderstanding. I wish no war.</p>

<p>But, know this: I will fight without rest for a Nation that treats all men and women equally and justly, for a Nation that values the content of a person&rsquo;s character more than the color of her skin, for a Nation that values peace and life over war and death, for a Nation governed by the rule of law not ruthless lawlessness.</p>

<p>This is what making America great, now, again, or ever, must surely mean.</p>

<p>Let us pledge our lives, fortunes, and sacred honor to this just cause, and let us pledge to do so in peace.</p>
