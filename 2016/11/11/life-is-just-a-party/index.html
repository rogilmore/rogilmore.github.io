      <p>Enough voters in enough states voted for Donald Trump to elect him to the most powerful position on the planet. Why? Voters wanted change. Or, so they told pollsters.</p>

<p>Drain the swamp, Trump supporters said.</p>

<p>But, the same voters returned a Republican Congress to power. The same Congress that collects fat paychecks from taxpayers while doing nothing. The same Congress that passes no laws and confirms no Supreme Court justices. The same Congress that voters tell pollsters they hate.</p>

<p>Send a message to elites, the media, and Wall Street voters said.</p>

<p>But, the same voters endorsed a billionaire businessman and reality TV star from New York City.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t think that these voters really cared about change or draining the swamp or sending messages to elites. They craved attitude.</p>

<p>They voted for the schmo they&rsquo;d want to have a beer with in hopes of meeting his hot wife. They voted against that smarty pantsuit bitch and against the Kenyan Muslim who sits in the chair now. They voted to say fuck you because saying it feels good. They blamed some other guy for their problems because, well, doesn&rsquo;t everybody?</p>

<p>But, make no mistake. Make America great again means make America hate (again).</p>

<p>And, as much as all of us crave quick and easy answers, there aren&rsquo;t any. Yes, the system is rigged and elites make out like bandits. But, Donald J. Trump is one of them. No alligator I ever met drains his own swamp.</p>

<p>I live in a neighborhood with many students, including lots of frat boys who went for Trump big time. We tolerate their incivilities and clean-up after their messes. We&rsquo;ll do the same for the country once this party ends. They always end.</p>
