    <div class="article-content">
      <p>I got into an argument with my father two years ago over a <a href="http://rick-gilmore.com/liberty-and-justice.html">blog post</a> I wrote in the midst of an epidemic of police killings of unarmed black men. The recent events at <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/nov/22/dakota-access-pipeline-protester-seriously-hurt-during-police-standoff-standing-rock">Standing Rock</a>, where my daughter Deb and her friends currently reside, have bearing on our disagreement.</p>

<p>My dad believes that civilians should obey police orders, and that those who do not put themselves at grave risk. I agree that disobeying police orders can put civilians in jeopardy. But, I understand the Bill of Rights to grant individual citizens the right to resist government power, especially when those citizens believe government power to be unjust. We are a nation pledged to the <em>rule</em> of law, but not one bound to blindly <em>submit</em> to its enforcement.</p>

<p>I suspect that many Americans believe the police are always right, that citizens should always submit to their demands, and that those who resist submission deserve their fates.</p>

<p>I strongly disagree. As taxpayer-funded representatives of government, police must place protecting the safety of <em>people</em> above all other priorities, including the protection of property. Government in general, but police in particular, must use the power we grant them judiciously, wisely, and sparingly.
Police power used to force unarmed citizens into submission is unjust.</p>
