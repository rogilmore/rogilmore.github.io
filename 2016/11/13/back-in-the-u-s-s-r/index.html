    <div class="article-content">
      <p>When I was a Republican about 20 years ago, it was an article of faith that my party defended American interests abroad in an assertive way. I grew up in the Cold War when the U.S.S.R was our adversary, baiting us at every turn and in every geopolitical corner. NATO was our bulwark in Europe against Soviet expansion, but we waged proxy wars everywhere. When I played a crude geopolitical role playing game on my first ever Macintosh, my refusal to accede to simulated Soviet provocations inevitably resulted in game-ending nuclear conflict.</p>

<p>So, it comes as a horrifying shock to learn that our new Republican president-elect has not only praised Russia&rsquo;s Vladimir Putin, but has had <a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/politics/ct-donald-trump-russia-20161110-story.html">regular back-channel contact with the Russian government for many months</a> while simultaneously <a href="http://www.tampabay.com/news/politics/national/russian-officials-were-in-contact-with-trump-campaign-diplomat-says/2302305">denying it</a>. Russian hackers stole DNC and Clinton campaign emails with the intent, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/08/us/politics/us-formally-accuses-russia-of-stealing-dnc-emails.html?_r=0">according to U.S. government sources</a>, of influencing the presidential campaign.</p>

<p>Maybe Russia became our close friend along the way, and I missed it.</p>

<p>Maybe the Russians are lying about the Trump campaign contacts to serve some other purpose.</p>

<p>Or, maybe we just chose a candidate who lied about communicating with a foreign adversary, an adversary that intervened in an election which brought him to power.</p>

<p>I beg my Republican friends to explain how this shouldn&rsquo;t terrify me and why it doesn&rsquo;t terrify them.</p>
