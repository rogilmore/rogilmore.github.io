    <div class="article-content">
      <p>Like many of you, I&rsquo;ve been heartsick at the recent stream of news about fatal encounters between unarmed black males and law enforcement. Heartsick because I still believe in the ideals our Founders strove to make real &ndash; that it is self-evident, and therefore unarguable, that <em>all</em> people are created equal and endowed with inalienable rights that include life, and liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. I am heartsick because we have so badly strayed from these ideals.</p>

<p>Most of us are most familiar with the lines from the <a href="http://www.archives.gov/exhibits/charters/declaration_transcript.html">Declaration of Independence</a> I have just paraphrased. But, I find the next line most apt:</p>

<p>&rdquo;&hellip;That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed &ndash; That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness&hellip;&rdquo;</p>

<p>These arms of government &ndash; the police, district attorneys, and judges &ndash; belong to <em>us</em>. We instituted them to secure our rights, and we sustain them with our tax dollars. They draw their powers, just or not, from us. When unarmed civilians are regularly deprived of their their lives by the powers of government through our police, those powers are no longer just. Those powers no longer reflect the consent of the governed. The forms of government we have created that empower law enforcement to kill unarmed civilians who are walking down the street, selling cigarettes, or playing in public parks undermine the founding principles of our Nation.</p>

<p>It is the right, no, <em>the responsibility</em> of the people to alter or abolish the policies that destroy the fundamental, inalienable, and inarguable rights of the governed. And, our Founders tell us, we must lay the new foundation on principles that preserve the safety and happiness of all.</p>

<p>We must end the killing of unarmed black people by police. It is unjust and unjustified.</p>

<p>Until we do so, we patriots pledge allegiance to the flag of a Nation divided, with liberty and justice for some only, and certain anguish for all.</p>
