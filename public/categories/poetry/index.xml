      <description>who shall lionize this deceased? and where pray tell shall the bodiless be interred? i know not where to lay bouquets nor what color on such civic holy-days that celebrate my dear departed.  the stones i have accumulated to mark a graveside visit stack cold
hurl them at the walls of this always glass but newly transparent house of cards. shatter or bounce. who cares?  when dreams die the pain sears as befits that without which we choose not to endure  but must.</description>

      <description>there&#39;s an elephant in this room. i like them, usually, but this one has her trunk in myâ€¦
you don&#39;t see it? but, there&#39;s hardly room to breathe, and then of course the smell. be careful where you step.
i don&#39;t know how it got here. they start small like everything else. slip in your back pocket or  through the eye of the needle blindly following some stupid camel or  summoned by incantations like this unsaid that.</description>

      <description>I flare my talons and prepare to strike, but only in defense. I sharpen my beak, but only in warning.
I am your presidential detail, your Secret Service. Vigilant. Committed. I seek out bullets fired in your direction by indifferent snipers and absorb their impact with joy. Unwounded.
I will carry your heart when it cannot be lifted. I will find you when you are lost even to yourself. I will light your darkness with the fire in my eyes, and we will crawl together out of the wilderness.</description>

      <description>oh my, yes. I oh so wanted to see a tuxedo, penguin crisp, satin shiny, pseudo-sparkle when he sauntered by us peons, clinging to such rags as misfortune left in her cloud of dust and tears. Coughing.
but, oh my no. no. Clad there not in finery, but in the simplest of suits. Birthday I am told the style. Flattered, but not flattering. Scoffing, not coughing.
And in seeing I could not unsee, despite I swear so wanting, you must believe, Nor in knowing could I unknow what what wisdom bears in its stoop and beard the penultimate emptiness of every emperor, penguin or man.</description>

      <description>the call always comes too early in the morning for anything but mischief or the baker
I know who&#39;s talking but not the language spoken.
hand on the bannister does not steady. the direction of gravity skewed by other forces of nature.
there now is down, but which way up?</description>

      <description>it&#39;s like fireworks, dad. you said the colors and patterns come from all the minerals. their making a mutual arrangement designed to ignite and illuminate.  you said the designers crafted this one boomy blue and that one sparkly-white. this cascade brilliant, that smiley face a dud.  flying high or bursting low, it&#39;s all in the timing and atmospheric conditions. don&#39;t forget chemistry and physics. human ingenuity (and error).</description>

      <description>One last time, Dad says. Jason squeals ands bolts inside the mister. Slippery guy.
The audacity of giant metal tin-men shames the humbler heart.
What are crab cheese fries? Regular with seasoning? Do they sell? Who knows?
The didgery-dude took a raincheck. See, honey, I should have bought one.
Nittany Lion mating calls echo &amp;lsquo;cross the Borough. Love me, do.</description>

      <description>yes she cranked the handle but the meat and potato man put his heart in the grinder and no one saved the pink spaghetti strands for chili.
 he could have had his cake and eaten humble pie or worn it as a badge of honorable intent. instead he tasted just desserts that fate sandwiched between margaritaville and a cheeseburger in paradise.  full of gumption Forest&#39;s mother disparaged the integrity of chocolates.</description>

      <description>Feeling sheepish? You try wearing wool in July. Ya think I&amp;rsquo;d chew this stuff if I could smoke it?
Hey, lady, let me juice yours.
I&#39;m past waiting for some sweet-talking spider to say I&#39;m super. The horse is an ass. Aren&#39;t they all? I don&#39;t relish rooster&#39;s cock &#39;em who&#39;ll do any more than you two. You see, cherie, he crows he wants to do me. If I could sleep in a bed, I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t roll in the hay.</description>

      <description>I strangled hope. Smug bastard annoyed me. I spring eternal; there is always room for me, he&#39;d say (or his fanboys would moonily recite). So I grabbed his throat and fingers clenched squeezed. his eyes bulged green then withered gray. he lay dishrag limp on my lap. I hissed a firehose sigh, a contrail marking passage across some cloudless sky and felt don&#39;t laugh full of...
Persistent bastard. Kill you again if I have the chance.</description>

      <description>My unicorn Is patron saint of regret. He holds dominion over Things wished-for but not received. the unfulfilled, unrequited, unrealized.
Get it? He says, I&#39;m like a Magritte or an Escher. Self-referential.
I don&#39;t. Or, I do, but I&#39;m wallowing.
Quite unselfservingly, He says I should shun the vaporous un.... and rather mind those things I got but did not think to wish for.
Treasure there, matey --  Forges to steel the metal in yer mettle; (He&#39;s fond of pirate talk, too.</description>

      <description>Gods I&#39;ve always viewed with skepticism, But, I met an angel named Shirley.
They don&#39;t wear wings, you know. Impractical indoors. Hard to fit under a winter coat. Showy. Too many feathers ruffled already.
Or halos. Lord knows we have enough of those.
Sensible shoes? You bet. Got to keep their footing sure.
Craig or Suzanne might play a little trumpet, but only in the municipal band.
And none of them want to wrestle, ok?</description>
