      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to move my blog to the blogdown package. I spend so much of my research life in RStudio it makes sense to move this direction.</description>

      <description>who shall lionize this deceased? and where pray tell shall the bodiless be interred? i know not where to lay bouquets nor what color on such civic holy-days that celebrate my dear departed.  the stones i have accumulated to mark a graveside visit stack cold
hurl them at the walls of this always glass but newly transparent house of cards. shatter or bounce. who cares?  when dreams die the pain sears as befits that without which we choose not to endure  but must.</description>

      <description>there&#39;s an elephant in this room. i like them, usually, but this one has her trunk in myâ€¦
you don&#39;t see it? but, there&#39;s hardly room to breathe, and then of course the smell. be careful where you step.
i don&#39;t know how it got here. they start small like everything else. slip in your back pocket or  through the eye of the needle blindly following some stupid camel or  summoned by incantations like this unsaid that.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve wanted to be an amateur radio operator since I was a little kid and read about the hobby in Boys&amp;rsquo; Life magazine. As a high schooler, I scraped together the pennies to buy a shortwave radio receiver, a Yaesu FRG-7, and with a long wire I ran up to the roof of my parents&amp;rsquo; house, I listened to the world. Catching the English language broadcast of Radio Tirana from Albania was a memorable highlight.</description>

      <description>I flare my talons and prepare to strike, but only in defense. I sharpen my beak, but only in warning.
I am your presidential detail, your Secret Service. Vigilant. Committed. I seek out bullets fired in your direction by indifferent snipers and absorb their impact with joy. Unwounded.
I will carry your heart when it cannot be lifted. I will find you when you are lost even to yourself. I will light your darkness with the fire in my eyes, and we will crawl together out of the wilderness.</description>

      <description>oh my, yes. I oh so wanted to see a tuxedo, penguin crisp, satin shiny, pseudo-sparkle when he sauntered by us peons, clinging to such rags as misfortune left in her cloud of dust and tears. Coughing.
but, oh my no. no. Clad there not in finery, but in the simplest of suits. Birthday I am told the style. Flattered, but not flattering. Scoffing, not coughing.
And in seeing I could not unsee, despite I swear so wanting, you must believe, Nor in knowing could I unknow what what wisdom bears in its stoop and beard the penultimate emptiness of every emperor, penguin or man.</description>

      <description>In my last post, I sketched out my workflow for using RStudio&amp;rsquo;s RMarkdown package to make HTML-based slides that I serve via GitHub and the RawGit service. I&amp;rsquo;m still a fan, but there is trouble in paradise. Or, I should say that it&amp;rsquo;s not yet paradise. So, in this post, I&amp;rsquo;ll describe some of my complaints. My mom always used to chide me &amp;ldquo;if you don&amp;rsquo;t have something nice to say, don&amp;rsquo;t talk.</description>

      <description>In keeping with my effort to move my research toward more open and reproducible practices, I decided to build all of my lecture slides in RMarkdown using RStudio, make my syllabus and assignments in Markdown, and generate exams and quizzes using LaTex and its Exam class. The lecture slide workflow involves several steps:
 Making slides in RStudio. Exporting them to HTML. Editing the syllabus file to add links to the HTML, RMarkdown, and sometimes PDF versions of the slides.</description>

      <description>it&#39;s like fireworks, dad. you said the colors and patterns come from all the minerals. their making a mutual arrangement designed to ignite and illuminate.  you said the designers crafted this one boomy blue and that one sparkly-white. this cascade brilliant, that smiley face a dud.  flying high or bursting low, it&#39;s all in the timing and atmospheric conditions. don&#39;t forget chemistry and physics. human ingenuity (and error).</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m giving a talk at the International Conference on Development and Learning/Epigenetic Robotics meeting in Providence in a few weeks. The talk offered me the chance to put into practice some of the software tools I&amp;rsquo;ve been trying to master. The goal was to create a presentation that used open source software components, version control, and included the actual code used to generate as many of the figures as possible. You can see the talk draft at http://gilmore-lab.</description>

      <description>Just before the curtain, I got the first hint. That was not a hay fever sneeze. The pharmacy was still open when I got to Euston Station after the show. I stocked up on cold remedies and went to check the departure track for the overnight to Edinburgh. Cancelled, the board said. I joined the queue at the customer service window. I could rebook on the first morning departure, but I&amp;rsquo;d miss my bus to the Western Highlands.</description>

Hey, lady, let me juice yours.

      <description>I strangled hope. Smug bastard annoyed me. I spring eternal; there is always room for me, he&#39;d say (or his fanboys would moonily recite). So I grabbed his throat and fingers clenched squeezed. his eyes bulged green then withered gray. he lay dishrag limp on my lap. I hissed a firehose sigh, a contrail marking passage across some cloudless sky and felt don&#39;t laugh full of...
Persistent bastard. Kill you again if I have the chance.</description>

      <description>My unicorn Is patron saint of regret. He holds dominion over Things wished-for but not received. the unfulfilled, unrequited, unrealized.
Get it? He says, I&#39;m like a Magritte or an Escher. Self-referential.
I don&#39;t. Or, I do, but I&#39;m wallowing.
Quite unselfservingly, He says I should shun the vaporous un.... and rather mind those things I got but did not think to wish for.

      <description>Gods I&#39;ve always viewed with skepticism, But, I met an angel named Shirley.
They don&#39;t wear wings, you know. Impractical indoors. Hard to fit under a winter coat. Showy. Too many feathers ruffled already.
Or halos. Lord knows we have enough of those.
Sensible shoes? You bet. Got to keep their footing sure.
Craig or Suzanne might play a little trumpet, but only in the municipal band.
And none of them want to wrestle, ok?</description>

      <description>My wife and I watched Amir Bar-Lev&amp;rsquo;s documentary, &amp;ldquo;Happy Valley&amp;rdquo; over the weekend. Our mutual reaction at the end of the movie was to note what a sad, sad story it tells. It was a familiar story, one we lived through. And, while much of the material was familiar, some of it was not.
We live close to campus &amp;ndash; on game day, we can hear the stadium roar when the Nittany Lions score.</description>

      <description>Databrary has received generous funding from NSF and NICHD in order to foster increased data sharing and reuse. In the almost four years I&amp;rsquo;ve worked on the project, I&amp;rsquo;ve learned a great deal about data repositories and open and transparent research practices. One thing has consistently stood out: Successful repositories attract research communities around datasets when the data have useful and searchable metadata. It&amp;rsquo;s not enough to store and share materials and data openly.</description>

      <description>The White House Office of Science and Technology Policy has asked for information from the public about how best to maximize the benefits to the public stemming from investments in science and technology. Here are the brief comments I submitted.
I believe that the Federal government has a key role to play in ensuring that public investments in scientific research have the maximum benefit. I speak to these issues as the grateful recipient of Federal support for my research from the National Science Foundation and the National Institutes of Health.</description>

      <description>We know that Databrary will have to compete against other data sharing services. Those of us who really enjoy building products and providing services that help others don&amp;rsquo;t like to talk about competing, but it&amp;rsquo;s a fact of life. Our project has generous support from NSF and NICHD now, but that&amp;rsquo;s no guarantee about the future of the project. We have to deliver a service that meets researcher&amp;rsquo;s needs. But, rather than worry about how Databrary can compete against Dropbox or Box or Amazon to provide cloud storage, we&amp;rsquo;re doing something else.</description>

      <description>YouTube is a fantastic service. I use it all the time in my teaching. But, those of us working on Databrary find ourselves saying &amp;ldquo;We&amp;rsquo;re not YouTube&amp;rdquo; on a regular basis. Here&amp;rsquo;s why.
Our core community consists of researchers who study infant and child development. We use video to collect the richest possible sample of behavior in natural or laboratory settings. Video often contains faces, voices, and names spoken aloud. This means that the videos could be used to determine the identity of research participants.</description>
