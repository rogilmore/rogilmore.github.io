    "text": "Amateur (ham) radio\nI was licensed as a Tech+ in 1993, but was never really active. Kids and finishing grad school were higher priorities. After reading “Seveneves,” I got the bug again and took both the Technician and General in the space of a couple of weeks in the summer of 2016. With the moral support of some fellow club members and a helpful Elmer, I upgraded to Extra in July of 2017.\nI enjoy VHF special event support, help run a local EmComm net, and serve as net control for the local QCWA net. I’m doing my best to chase DX on 20 and 40 m using an IC-7300 and FlexRadio 6400. In the fall of 2019, I added tuned dipoles for 20m and 40m, and in the Spring of 2020, I added a Comet 3 for better VHF and UHF coverage. In 2022, I put up an 80-10m EFHW in place of the tuned 20m/40m dipole, and I also put up a DX Commander vertical.\nTo help with our local APRS coverage, I also run a fill-in digipeater/I-Gate.\nI took the CW Academy courses to (re)learn the code in hopes of doing QRP SOTA and POTA type of activations. That seems like an ideal way to combine my love of outdoor activities (hiking, cycling, and paddling) with ham radio. But, my CW journey stalled. It’s hard to teach an old brain new tricks. Let’s hope that getting active in the Long Island CW Club will help me get over the hurdle.\nMy local club is the Nittany Amateur Radio Club. I check-in to the Western PA D-Star net occasionally, and often monitor the 146.85 W3YA repeater and the Yaesu System Fusion AmericaLink reflector. In Spring 2020, I joined the Board of Directors of NARC.\nIn 2019, I took over as Faculty Adviser for the Penn State Amateur Radio Club. I am also trustee for the three K3CR repeaters.\nFinally, in late 2022, I applied for the phonetically and CW-wise shorter callsign, W3TM. Changing callsigns is a royal pain if you’ve been active for awhile, and ham friends are still struggling to use the new call. But we’re getting there.\nMore information about my amateur radio activities can be found at https://w3tm.org."

Indeed, my wife and I met in a production of “South Pacific” with the Georgetown Gilbert & Sullivan Society (GG&SS). I played “The Professor” if you can believe it.\nShows here in State College have included “Oliver!”, “The Sound of Music,” and “Sweeney Todd,” with Singing Onstage, “Dracula”, “The Survivor”, and “Gypsy” with the State College Community Theatre (SCCT), and “The Memory of Water”, “Harper Regan”, and “Two Can Play” with The Next Stage theatre company, and in Spring 2022, “Fallout” produced by Elaine Meder-Wilgus.\nI am a former president of SCCT. I’m proud to say that my colleagues and I forced the owners of the Boal Barn to make essential repairs to the facility.\nNeedless to say, I love to sing and dance. My wife and daugther are the instrumentalists, but I pick a banjo now and then or play a bit of harmonica or tin whistle.\nMy wife and I also enjoy volunteering with the Acoustic Brew concert series and attending shows. We rejoined the board in 2021, and I once again serve as president. Please come see why ’the Brew’ has endured over 30 years.\nWhen the spirit moves me, I write poetry And when I remember, I take photographs."

Then the same distractions that made me put ham radio aside intruded. But in the last year or so, I’ve gotten involved with CPO again.\nEarlier this spring, I bought a ZWO Seestar S50. Here are some of my first photos with it:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Moon\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Moon\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nM31 Andromeda Galaxy\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nM42 The Orion Nebula\n\n\n\n\n\nI have a kit in-hand for a radiotelescope to participate in the Radio JOVE project. When time permits, I hope to put it on the air.\nAnd, my wife and I are hoping to see the totality during the April 8, 2024 solar eclipse! Cross your fingers for cloud-less weather."

In 2018 to celebrate our 25th anniversary, my wife and I took a tour of southern Tuscany with Vermont Bicycle Tours (VBT). I’m what some might call a “half-fast” cyclist."

I am currently the elected Judge of Elections. I was a moderate Republican at one point, but changed parties soon after the 2000 election.\nMy wife and I were formerly Democratic Precinct Co-chairs.\nI’m especially proud of the work that led to the construction of the Bellefonte Central Rail Trail. It was one of our community’s constructive responses to 9/11. Just weeks after the attack, more than 100 volunteers cleared the first overgrown section of railbed.\nI served on the State College Borough Transportation Commission back the early 2000’s and again from 2020-2022. In a previous rotation on the Commission, we helped implement traffic calming speed humps in the Highlands neighborhood, pedestrian lead times in the downtown district, and plan for a set of bike lanes. If you enjoy the “Bikes Park Free” bike rack in front of Panera in downtown State College, I’m proud to say I helped write the grant that made that a reality."

    "text": "One stats class was required in my grad program, and Mike Meyer was my professor. The class was in S-plus, the closed source inspiration for R. And Mike regularly exhorted us (in his inimitable Australian accent), “Plot your data!”\nMike’s encouragment to use S-plus made it easier for me to adopt R when it appeared on the scene a few years later. Or at least I had fewer habits to change. And, Mike’s advice about plotting your data first always made sense to me. If you can’t see a pattern in the plots, how can you believe the inferential statistics?\nIn that spirit, mostly so that I can find it again, is an outstanding demonstration of that truth, the datasauRus package, based on Anscombe’s quartet (Anscombe 1973), which is also available as the anscombe package.\n\nlibrary(\"ggplot2\")\nlibrary(\"datasauRus\")\nggplot(datasaurus_dozen, aes(x = x, y = y, colour = dataset))+\n  geom_point() +\n  theme_void() +\n  theme(legend.position = \"none\")+\n  facet_wrap(~dataset, ncol = 3)\n\n\n\n\nDatasauRus figures\n\n\n\n\nThese all have roughly the same summary statistics.\n\nif(requireNamespace(\"dplyr\")){\n  suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(dplyr))\n  datasaurus_dozen %&gt;% \n    group_by(dataset) %&gt;% \n    summarize(\n      mean_x    = mean(x),\n      mean_y    = mean(y),\n      std_dev_x = sd(x),\n      std_dev_y = sd(y),\n      corr_x_y  = cor(x, y)\n    )\n}\n\n# A tibble: 13 × 6\n   dataset    mean_x mean_y std_dev_x std_dev_y corr_x_y\n   &lt;chr&gt;       &lt;dbl&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt;\n 1 away         54.3   47.8      16.8      26.9  -0.0641\n 2 bullseye     54.3   47.8      16.8      26.9  -0.0686\n 3 circle       54.3   47.8      16.8      26.9  -0.0683\n 4 dino         54.3   47.8      16.8      26.9  -0.0645\n 5 dots         54.3   47.8      16.8      26.9  -0.0603\n 6 h_lines      54.3   47.8      16.8      26.9  -0.0617\n 7 high_lines   54.3   47.8      16.8      26.9  -0.0685\n 8 slant_down   54.3   47.8      16.8      26.9  -0.0690\n 9 slant_up     54.3   47.8      16.8      26.9  -0.0686\n10 star         54.3   47.8      16.8      26.9  -0.0630\n11 v_lines      54.3   47.8      16.8      26.9  -0.0694\n12 wide_lines   54.3   47.8      16.8      26.9  -0.0666\n13 x_shape      54.3   47.8      16.8      26.9  -0.0656\n\n\nAnd here are the originals from (Anscombe 1973):\n\nwith(anscombe, plot(x1, y1))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwith(anscombe, plot(x2, y2))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwith(anscombe, plot(x3, y3))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwith(anscombe, plot(x4, y4))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThanks for giving me such a great start in statistics, Mike!

    "text": "After working through the configuration settings for W3TM.org, I decided to overhaul my personal website and blog. I’d been using the excellent Netlify service, and there had been no problems. But it seemed prudent to apply the same configuration to my other blog and site.\nThe process was as follows:\n\nRemove the automatic build and publishing configuration from Netlify.\nMove the site to my personal GitHub account (rogilmore) under the ‘rogilmore.github.io’ repo. This repo has special status that will make it easier for me to make project-specific sites in the future.\nVerifying my custom domain for GitHub pages. I followed the steps outlined here. This involved changing the DNS configuration parameters from my domain registrar.\nAdding the appropriate A records to the DNS configuration so that ‘rick-gilmore.com’ would point to the GitHub pages servers. I followed these steps.

This required some changes to the rendering parameters for the site. I have come to prefer separate ‘src/’ and ‘docs/’ directories for my repos. This means that ’src/_quarto.yml’ must have the following:\n\nproject:\n  type: website\n  output-dir: \"../docs\"\n\nAdd the custom ‘rick-gilmore.com’ domain to GitHub pages and permit the DNS check.\n\nThat seemed to work."

    "text": "Several years ago, Florian Raudies, Swapnaa Jayaraman and I published a paper where we simulated the optic flow that infants would experience in different head/body postures. We computed cyclopian (one-eyed) flow on the basis of this schematic:\n\nHere, the key parameters were the instantaneous translation \\((v_x{}, v_y{}, v_z{})\\) and rotation \\((\\omega_{x}, \\omega_y{}, \\omega_z{})\\) of the planar retina. Coupled with the optic flow equation,\n\\(\\begin{pmatrix}\\dot{x} \\\\ \\dot{y}\\end{pmatrix}=\\frac{1}{z} \\begin{pmatrix}-f & 0 & x\\\\ 0 & -f & y \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix}{v_x{}}\\\\ {v_y{}} \\\\{v_z{}}\\end{pmatrix}+ \\frac{1}{f} \\begin{pmatrix} xy & -(f^2+x^2) & fy\\\\ f^2+y^2 & -xy & -fy \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} \\omega_{x}\\\\ \\omega_{y}\\\\ \\omega_{z} \\end{pmatrix}\\)\nwe were able to simulate the perceptual effects of postural geometry: Changes in eye height and forward translational speed that would occur when a child changed from crawling to walking altered the pattern of retinal flow \\((\\dot{x}, \\dot{y})\\) in interesting ways.\nThis work has lain dormant for a few years, but I now want to pick it back up. In short, there are a handful of perception/action systems that provide the nervous system with deterministic, causal information about the effects of different actions. These must be important for development.\nFor the next step, I’m looking for a concise, but thorough parameterization of body posture that includes the eyes, head, torso, arms, and legs. Here’s a sketch of what I have in mind for the upper parts body that have the greatest impact on the direction of visual fixation:\n\n\n\nBody part\nParameter(s)\n\n\n\n\nEyes\n${rx}, {ry}, {lx}, {lx} $\n\n\nHead\n\\(\\theta_x{}, \\theta_y{}, \\theta_z{}\\)\n\n\nTorso\n$_x{}, _y{}, _z{} $\n\n\n\nCoupled with the distance between the eyes, \\(i\\), the radial distance to the head’s center of rotation, \\(h\\), and the distance from the head’s center of rotation to the torso’s center of rotation, \\(t\\), we can compute the effects of eye, head, and torso movement on visual motion at the two retinae. Now, if the visual signals from eye vs. head vs. torso can be distinguished, then these could couple with other proprioceptive (muscle, tendon, cutaneous) signals to provide a powerful set of sensory signals that are directly caused by eye, head, and torso motion. See this earlier post for a causal graph that elaborates on this point. I’ll discuss why I think there are visual differences in the effects of eye and head motion in a future post.\nMy next step is to ask my colleagues in kinesiology if there is a canonical parameterization of body position that I can build upon. If you know of one, let me know."

Not always well the record shows, but sometimes.\nMany times, too many, the poems respond to death or a close encounter, or other forms of heartbreak, including the self-inflicted sort.\nI gather them here because the desire to remember feels large to me.

And though we compete fiercely for space, students, grants, renown, raises, attention and favors from higher-ups, we also (mostly) deny that we are competitors.\nBut reality bites whether or not we see the teeth.\nIn reality, academic institutions like mine are business incubators or venture capitalists. They are run by people who seek concrete returns on investment (ROIs). Just like a business incubator, seed investments are made in individual investigators whose advancement depends on the construction of vertically integrated enterprises with their name at the top. Credit for team projects is divided into portions even when the whole is far more than the sum of the parts. Individual researchers are expected to learn, without training, orientation, or support, how to navigate a gigantic bureaucracy in order to build their individual brands.\nA speaker at a recent event I attended remarked that greater communication among researchers working on similar problems would accelerate discovery, especially in cutting edge fields. Too often, the speaker observed, people down the hall or across campus from one another are working on the same problems without knowledge of one another’s efforts. It’s hard to disagree. But when researchers demand firewalls to prevent their colleagues down the hall from stealing intellectual property, it’s also not hard to understand why that communication doesn’t happen.\nAcademic scholarship is not a team sport. And that’s okay. Not everyone likes team sports or teamwork for that matter. I just wish we were more honest with ourselves and our trainees about this fundamental structural fact. It makes all sorts of things about life here in the ivory tower much clearer, at least to me."

Our neighborhood has permanent residents and more transient ones, usually Penn State students. So, many of the voters who show up on election day, especially in a presidential election year, do so for the first time. Some of them come to our precinct because that’s the one in their neighborhood even though they might be registered in another precinct. If they aren’t registered in our precinct, we help them find out if they are registered and where they are registered. That’s not always easy to do, but we know which websites to have them check and how to advise them about their options.\nMore than 20 states offer same day voting and registration. Pennsylvania is not one of them. We do our best with the system we have.\nThis year, we had a small number of students show up who weren’t registered in Pennsylvania at all. We advised them they could only vote a provisional ballot and that it was extremely unlikely that their vote would ultimately be counted. Most chose to vote anyway, just in case there was a chance that their vote might count. So, we helped these voters cast a provisional ballot, putting the decision about which ballots would ultimately be counted in the final in the hands of our county’s election board. Most importantly, we did not stand in the way of any voter casting a ballot.\nWe do these things in our precinct because we believe that every voter counts even if every single vote does not. We do these things because many of us are educators, and we believe that encouraging habits of civic engagement are part of the legacy we want to leave. We do these things because we believe that our union is stronger when more people participate in decisions about who should lead. We do this because powerful forces throughout the history of our country have tried to restrict access to the ballot box and those forces are still active today. We do these things because we believe that the process is more important than the outcome. We do these things because they reflect what the Founders meant when they described their motivations for establishing the Constitution:\n“…to form a more perfect union, establish justice, ensure domestic tranquility, provide for the common defense, promote the general welfare, and secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity…”\nOur union is far from perfect, justice is not always done, and we are far from tranquil. But the actions by Mr. Trump and his supporters to undermine the integrity of the election–before it had occurred and in its aftermath–are deeply and profoundly wrong. To allege voting fraud without any actual evidence undermines the common defense, erodes the general welfare, and threatens the blessings of liberty. And for election officials like me who work hard to ensure a fair and just voting process for everyone, the allegations are more than a little personal."

First, that required renting copies from the library along with the required projection equipment. Later, it was easily found on YouTube. Still later, I embedded it in my lecture notes, as below.\nIn subsequent years, others have taken the basic idea and created their own takes. But I have special love for the original version with its cheesy special effects and understated but astonishing narration.\nWhile traveling faster than the speed of light may violate the laws of physics, at some point it occurred to me that such travel does not break any law of psychology. We easily travel substantially faster than light powered solely by our own imaginations. So, fueled, we even travel places that never were and cannot be.\nBut I didn’t really grasp the impact of the difference between the absolute speed of light and the effectively unlimited speed of mind until I found this video that simulates just how slow the speed of light actually is.

I even played my first blues solo on the harmonica, thanks to the encouragement of master performer and master teacher, Richard Sleigh.

These are especially difficult times for members of the LGBTQ+ community in the U.S., so it was gratifying to appreciate first-hand what the center’s opening means to this group of marginalized friends, family, and colleagues.

But the cruising yachts we crawled all over were as unlike my grandparents’ camper as they could possibly be. They were party pads that slept 8-10 with ensuite baths and tablet controls. Oh, and they also sail from here to there with self-tacking jibs.\nI fully understand how so many people envision the cruising lifestyle as their ultimate dream. For me, I don’t really fantasize about owning a boat like that. But to my surprise, I now think that chartering one would make a fun vacation. A workshop about cruising the small towns around the Chesapeake Bay made that sound especially attractive, and it’s close by so we might actually do it some day. And, less surprising since I went into the show with this mindset: I definitely want to learn to sail. Next summer."

    "text": "In PSYCH 490 this week we discussed a paper (Chopik et al. 2018) that surveyed undergraduate students’ knowledge about open science practices before and after a short 1-hour lecture.\nI got a bee in my bonnet about how to create a set of similar plots programmatically, using metaprogramming. The idea is to write code that creates ‘knittable’ markdown so that when the full document is rendered, you get nice looking HTML or PDF or whatever your output format happens to be.\nIt’s a bear to program though, because you have to keep in mind what sort of text is considered properly formatted input to each stage of the process. In fact, a functional programming approach is almost required, at least for mere mortals like me. And there are some tricks to feeding functions lists of variables embedded in a data frame in a way that they can be used in functions like ggplot() and the dplyr family. Nevertheless, he persisted. And in the end, I got it to work.\nHere is a very brief example to demonstrate that I can do it again.\nFirst, I create two helper functions.\n\nsuppressPackageStartupMessages(library(tidyverse))\n\nmy_freq_plot &lt;- function(data = mtcars, var) {\n  data |&gt;\n    ggplot() +\n    aes(.data[[var]]) +\n    geom_freqpoly(na.rm = TRUE,\n                  show.legend = FALSE,\n                  bins = 30)\n}\n\nreturn_section &lt;- function(data, var) {\n  chunk_hdr &lt;- knitr::knit_expand(text = c(\"### Plot of: `{this_var}`\",\n                                           \"\\n\"),\n                                  this_var = var)\n  \n  # Build fig.cap from ground up\n  fig_name &lt;- paste0(\"fig-dist-\", var)\n  fig_cap &lt;- paste0(\"'Plot of responses to \", var, \"'\")\n  fig_caption &lt;- paste0(\"fig.cap = \", fig_cap)\n  \n  plot_chunk_hdr &lt;- paste0(\"```{r \", fig_name, \", echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE, \", fig_caption, \"}\")\n  \n  plot_chunk &lt;- c(plot_chunk_hdr,\n                   \"print(my_freq_plot(data, var))\",\n                  \"```\")\n\n  knitr::knit_child(\n    text = c(chunk_hdr, plot_chunk),\n    envir = environment(),\n    quiet = TRUE\n  )\n}\n\nThen I create a set of figures from the mtcars database. To keep things simple, I’ll just pick the first three variables.\nthese_vars &lt;- names(mtcars)[1:3]\n\nres &lt;- invisible(lapply(these_vars, return_section, data = mtcars))\ncat(unlist(res), sep = \"\\n\")\n\nPlot of: mpg\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Plot of responses to mpg\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlot of: cyl\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Plot of responses to cyl\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlot of: disp\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Plot of responses to disp\n\n\n\n\n\nThis could certainly be optimized. But it works, and it’s enough of an example that I can use it again in the future. In fact, I tweaked this example ever so slightly from the one I used for my class website. That, to me, is reproducibility.\nAnd, if this was a document that generated a table of contents, creating level 2 (##) or 3 (###) headers this way would automatically add the subsection titles to the TOC. Sweet, eh?\nSome observations about what finally worked are listed below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost hoc thoughts\n\n\n\nThe keys were as follows:\n\nIn return_chunk(), generate separate text strings for the header (chunk_hdr) and the plot chunk (plot_chunk). See also the sequence for building a suitable string for fig.cap.\nCombine these separate pieces within knitr::knit_child() with the text=... parameter.\nIn my_freq_plot(), use the aes(.data[[var]]) syntax to turn the string value for var into an unquoted variable in the dataset. Remember, the input to return_section() is an array of variable names from mtcars as strings.\nIn the chunk that generates the markdown, make sure to add results=\"asis\".\n\nBottom line: It’s always better to bite off smaller chunks.\nAnd big props to (Rodrigues 2023) for getting me started on this particular journey.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nChopik, William J, Ryan H Bremner, Andrew M Defever, and Victor N Keller. 2018. “How (and Whether) to Teach Undergraduates about the Replication Crisis in Psychological Science.” Teaching of Psychology 45 (2): 158–63. https://doi.org/10.1177/0098628318762900.\n\n\nRodrigues, Bruno. 2023.

    "section": "",
    "text": "A recent article in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences by Redish et al. argues that ‘reproducibility failures are essential to scientific inquiry.’ The authors remind readers that progress in many fields often proceeds haltingly, with successes, retrenchments, reconsiderations, and revisions. As examples, Redish et al. summarize the history of the Four Color Theorem, the claim that Fourier series can characterize any function, and the conditions under which neural networks can carry out certain computations. I find useful these reminders from mathematics and computer science that progress and regress are essential parts of the trajectory of scientific discovery, but I find unconvincing arguments that ‘many of the current concerns about reproducibility overlook the dynamic, iterative nature of the process of discovery.’\nAccording to a 2016 survey in Nature, some 90% of scientists surveyed agreed that ‘there is a reproducibility crisis.’ Sixty to eighty percent of scientists in fields from chemistry to earth and environmental sciences reported failing to reproduce someone else’s experiment, and 40-60% reported failing to reproduce their own experiments. Respondents expressed widely-ranging opinions about ‘how much published work in your field is reproducible?’ Curiously, physicists and chemists were most confident in the literature AND most likely to report having failed to reproduce a study. Perhaps chemists and physicists are more likely to attempt to reproduce published results than scientists in other fields.\nRedish et al. rightly point out that no single study should be viewed as definitive, and that discovering robust findings takes time. But I think the authors miss an opportunity to talk about what specific practices accelerate the process of discovery and what practices retard it. Open sharing of results, positive and negative, data, experimental procedures, analysis code, and materials accelerates progress. In the fields of psychology, vision science, and neuroscience I am most familiar with, failures to replicate are almost impossible to publish. If the failures aren’t published, discovering the reasons for the failure will be difficult to discern. Open data, materials, analysis code, and procedure sharing are slowly growing in popularity, but still not commonplace. Without ready access to these elements, it is almost certain that attempts to replicate will differ from the original finding in ways that may or may not be readily apparent.\nRedish et al. state:\n\nA failure to reproduce is only the first step in scientific inquiry. In many ways, how science responds to these failures is what determines whether it succeeds.\n\nI agree. And the response of many open science advocates is to encourage our colleagues to adopt more transparent practices in reporting and sharing results, data, analyses, and materials, and to build tools for making this easy. If we want to build ‘a genuinely cumulative science’, to borrow a phrase from Walter Mischel, we need to attend to improving the processes of self-correction that Redish et al. rightly point out are endemic to science and essential to its power. Right now, it’s far too difficult for researchers to learn about failures to replicate or generalize and far too difficult to explore the reasons why. So perhaps the crisis of reproducibility is more usefully thought of as a crisis of transparency, and if this is so, there are ready solutions at hand."

    "text": "My local club, the Nittany Amateur Radio Club (NARC) has organized an APRS/Packet Special Interest Group. I’ve been an active APRS operator since early in my ham career. Among other activities, I operate a receive-only I-Gate. What’s gotten me excited about the SIG is the motivation to put a packet radio station on the air. NARC operates a packet bulletin board system (BBS) on 145.030 MHz, and it’s in a high elevation location that I can hit with compromise antennas and low power.\nSo, how proceed? I have packet capability with the ICOM IC-705 that sits on my desk, but using it requires me to connect my Evolve III laptop, and to stop scanning the local VHF and UHF repeaters. Weather and family commitments have put my satellite operation ambitions on hold until spring. So, I decided to put the new ICOM IC-9700 to work.\nLike the IC-7300, IC-9700 has a USB interface. That makes it easy to handle audio in and out via USB and rig control. So, it was easy to configure the UZ7HO Soundmodem software modem to handle audio and PTT while connected to my existing PC in the shack. All that I needed was to make sure I had a vacant USB port. Then, it was straightforward to install and connect Outpost Packet Manager, and bingo, I was able to send messages and read BBS posts. My shack PC permits remote operation using Google Remote Desktop, so I am able to operate the packet station remotely, as well.\nNext, I decided to work on creating a more nimble packet station using a spare HT. With a Digirig external soundcard/PTT interface, a cable for my ICOM ID-51a, the ID-51a, and the Evolve III laptop mentioned earlier, I have a low-power, portable packet station.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nLet me give a shout out to Denis, K0TX, the owner of Digirig. He’s extremely responsive to user questions.\n\n\n\n\n\nImage from https://digirig.net\n\n\nA ham friend who has a love/hate relationship with packet sometimes calls it 1980s technology, and he’s not wrong. But so what? It worked in the 1980s, and it still works. More important, it’s fun, and that’s what ham radio is about."

Then the products were all on paper, and searching Census records meant going to a library and using the microfiche. It helped that I have Mormon cousins, and so we could share our findings about the shared branches of the family tree.\nWhen my daughter and son-in-law asked about family names in their search to find suitable ones for their then child-to-be, I searched everywhere for that black three-ring binder. But, it was nowhere to be found. So, mostly in frustration, I signed on to Ancestry.com and the Family Tree service. The goal was to reconstitute the old work, but the new electronic tools made that a very low bar. Within a few hours, I’d surpassed all of that old work, and had easily extended the family tree back multiple generations.\nTwo surprises stood out:\n\nI am very American. You have to go back to the mid-1800s to find the first relative who was not born here. And in some lines, my American roots go back 10 or more generations.\nNone of my relatives seem to have fought for the South in the Civil War, even those living in Missouri. Since America is still fighting that war in many respects, I was relieved to know that my ancestors didn’t join the fight to preserve slavery. Many people fought and died in the Civil War because they were conscripted and had no real choice, but a self-evident truth I hold closely is that America is a better country because the South lost.\n\nStill, ancestry is only biological destiny, and even then, only in part. Some of my ancestors had only a single child, and without that child, there is no me. What tangled webs we weave."

    "text": "I’ve been a ham for only a few years. In that time, I’ve enjoyed sampling the hobby’s many facets. When I first heard about ham radio as a boy, the thrills were mostly about talking by voice and CW (Morse code) to stations around the world. Now there are dozens of digital (computer-to-computer) modes, styles of operating, and bands to operate on.\nI learned a bit of Morse code back when I was first licensed in 1993. But in my second reincarnation as a ham, the code requirements had been dropped, and so there was no compelling reason to learn it. Except that I wanted to. For reasons I don’t quite understand, I’m drawn to learn skills that don’t have much practical use but have a venerable history and still attract enthusiasts. Playing clawhammer banjo is one, and learning to operate CW (the transmission mode that turns Morse code into radio waves) is another.\nSo, after starting one of the CW Academy courses in January 2019, I tried again this year. I took the Beginner class earlier this year, and I’m now 2/3 of the way through the Basic class. The instructors are fantastic. The curriculum is well-structured and useful. I’ve made significant progress. But, boy is it hard!\nWhen I was younger, any number of new things came to me rather easily. Not everything, but many things. And I grew accustomed to thinking I was a fast learner. Welcome to middle age. As with learning the banjo, or learning lines or music for a theatrical production, I find that I have to work much, much harder than I did when I was younger. Or alternatively, I have to adjust my expectations about how much progress I’ll see with the amount of work I put in.\nIt’s also humbling, but gratifying to be on the other side of the teaching lectern. I think all professors should find ways to be students, again. Puts things into perspective.\nAnd I’m sure that when all the dits and dahs finally sound like words to my brain–they’re starting to, every now and then–I’ll be glad I stayed the course. There’s something magical about reaching out to another person and talking with them over the airwaves, and especially when it’s in a ‘language’ that started the age of radio communication."

Silberzahn et al. 2018). The main take home message is that different data analysts can take widely varied approaches to answering the same question from the same dataset. It’s a fun and fascinating read.\nBut after asking the students whether or not the paper had persuaded them that players with darker skin tones get more red cards, I realized that nowhere in the paper was a graph that addressed this particular question. So, I got busy trying to work through just how one might explore that question graphically.\nThe result is a whole page of graphs. Probably the least surprising are the ones showing that the number of yellow cards and red cards are related to one another, whether viewed from a player perspective\n\n\n\nPlot of data shared by (R.

Interested casual readers might also enjoy Steve Sloman’s excellent and delightfully clear Causal Models: How People Think About the World and Its Alternatives.\nIn this post, I want to build a model for how an observer perceives visual motion given various possible causes.\nNOTE: The following code no longer runs as of 2023-08-31.\n\nlibrary(DiagrammeR)\n\nnodes &lt;- create_node_df(\n  n = 15,\n  label = c(\"retinal motion\", \"eye mvmt\", \"head mvmt\", \"body mvmt\", \"object mvmt\", \"passive transp\", \"eye cmd\", \"head cmd\", \"body cmd\", \"eye prop\", \"head prop\", \"head vest\", \"body prop\", \"entity\", \"passive force\"),\n  type = \"number\"\n)\n\nedges &lt;- create_edge_df(\n  from = c(2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4, 14, 15),\n  to = c(1, 1, 1, 1, 4, 2, 3, 4, 10, 11, 12, 12, 13, 5, 5),\n  rel = \"related\"\n)\n\ngraph &lt;- DiagrammeR::create_graph(nodes_df = nodes, \n                                  edges_df = edges)\n\ngraph %&gt;% DiagrammeR::render_graph()\n\nThe figure implies that motion on the retina comes from the movement of objects in the environment, movement of the observer, specifically the eyes, head, or body, or a combination of any of these. Eye movements stem from eye movement commands; head movements (translations and rotations) stem from head movement commands; body movements stem from commands to move the body. Movements of the eyes, head, or body generate proprioceptive signals from the eyes, head, and body. These signals derive from muscle, joint, and tendon receptors. Rotational and translational motion of the head stimulates vestibular signals.\nNote that retinal motion caused by the observer has multiple non-visual correlates (or consequences) that are detectable under typical circumstances. There may also be differences in the specific properties of motion caused by eye, head, body, or object motion. We’ll discuss these in a future post.\nSo, the task for perception is to answer the question: What’s moving and why?"

    "text": "We don’t own our data\nMost researchers feel a strong sense of ownership about our data and often, properly so I think, feel especially protective of our research participants. The fact remains, however, that despite our essential role in determining what data get collected from whom and how, we researchers have the weakest claim to actually owning the data we collect.\nIn the U.S., if my work is funded by a grant from the Federal government (e.g., NSF or NIH), then that award is actually made to my institution, not me. In fact, if I am unable to fulfill the obligations of the award, my institution may, and often will, appoint another person to do so. If my work is funded by another source, that source is likely to have implemented similar provisions. So, in reality, while researchers have a primary stewardship role over research data, it likely belongs to our institution.\nIn other contexts, the EU, for example, strong arguments have been made that research participants actually own their data. I am sympathetic to these arguments and believe that empowering individuals to grant researchers specific permission to use their data is the best path toward a future of ethical data use. Implementing that vision at-scale poses substantial challenges I believe academic researchers can eventually meet. The point of convergence is that researchers don’t own the data we collect.\nNot owning the data nevertheless means that we researchers must still think carefully about how best to protect it, our participants, and our institutions. As a practical matter, even though our institutions (or research participants) may own the data, we are the ones best positioned to determine what happens to those data when our project ends. In other words, the responsibility for determining the future life, if any, of our research data is one we can’t meaningfully shirk or easily ignore. At the same time, because the data aren’t really ours, considerations about any personal or career risk associated with sharing data can’t be at the center of the discussion. Instead, our obligations to research participants, our institutions, and funding agencies must take precedence. This means that fear of being scooped probably isn’t sufficient justification to withhold sharing data."

    "text": "Sharing data publicly without restriction is unnecessary and poses unforseen risks\nI believe that some of my colleagues who are skeptical about data sharing understand the practice to mean sharing data in publicly accessible ways. These skeptics argue that they don’t have permission to share data that way, and thus doing so would violate research ethics. I agree.\nIn fact, I go further. I am worried that we woefully underestimate the risks of participant reidentifiability associated with combining public and private data sets, even when research data have been stripped of conventional identifiers. Imagine if Bernie Sanders and Donald Trump had taken intro psych classes and the ‘deidentified’ data were publicly available to anyone today. Doesn’t it seem likely, certain even, that large well-funded teams of data scientists would be scouring the internet in order to try to expose Bernie’s answer to this survey question or Donald’s score on that cognitive test?\nWe can’t predict the future, but we can try to shape it.\nRather than make open, public sharing of data about human beings the expected norm, I suggest we build on an existing track-record of sharing these sorts data with restricted audiences. The Inter-university Consortium on Political and Social Research (ICSPR) at the University of Michigan has been storing and sharing data with restricted audiences for almost 60 years. The U.S. Census has developed procedures for allowing restricted access to individual Census survey responses in highly secure and protected environments. The Databrary data library that I co-founded and co-direct has created a data library for openly sharing video and audio recordings with a restricted community of researchers. There are numerous examples of data sets shared by the U.S. government (e.g., NDAR) that have various restrictions on who can access data and for what purposes.\nThese examples illustrate that open data sharing need not be synonymous with public data sharing. The ICPSR and Census examples especially show that even the most sensitive data can be successfully shared with responsible researchers.\nYes, restricted sharing with researchers affiliated with institutions of higher learning or academic medical centers is ‘elitist’ to some degree. But the checks and balances these institutions provide – research ethics training, research review committees, research supervision, secure data storage infrastructure – protect research participants in ways that public data sharing schemes simply cannot, at least not now. I think this form of elitism is justified in the name of protecting research participants. Or at the very least, that restricting data about human participants should be the norm unless and until we can be highly confident that public sharing truly poses minimal risk.\nThus, I conclude the following:\n\nVirtually all data about human research participants can be shared in some form.\nThe standard for sharing data about human research participants should be to use a data repository that restricts access to specific individuals for purposes subject to external review.\nAll researchers who collect data about human research participants should be collecting permission to share information from their participants so that any data sharing activities are in accord with participants’ wishes. There are readily available templates researchers can adapt for seeking sharing permission. Going forward there is no reason for ‘failure to secure permission to share’ to be a meaningful impediment.\n\nNow, some may argue that the cost of securing permission to share and storing data in restricted repositories versus publicly accessible places must be weighed against the benefits. I don’t disagree that costs and benefits must be weighed, but it is often hard to weigh them objectively. Instead, I think it is safer to say that we have a longer history of and familiarity with restricted data sharing and more information about the costs of preparing data to share in these sorts of settings. So the surer bet in the long-term is to build on what has already been working. The risks of widespread public data sharing are a ‘known-unknown’, in Donald Rumsfeld’s categorical scheme, while the risks of restricted data sharing are ‘known-knowns’. I do not share Mr. Rumsfeld’s politics, but I find his thinking incisive and useful in this context.\nOne final point in favor of restricted sharing in centralized repositories is metadata standardization. If we view data sharing as an investment in future scholarship, then sharing data in standard ways that others can combine, reuse, and build upon is essential. By design (e.g., Databrary, government-sponsored data repositories) or long-standing practice (ICSPSR), data repositories provide standard metadata elements that make data more readily discoverable and reusable. Of course, curating data to meet these metadata standards takes time, but the payoff comes in accelerated resuse and discovery.\nSo, data about human participants should be shared (with permission) in data repositories that restrict access and support standardized metadata, and all of us who do research with human participants should be seeking explicit permission to share in these ways."

    "section": "Sharing data, materials, and analysis scripts is more important to open science than pre-registration",
    "text": "Sharing data, materials, and analysis scripts is more important to open science than pre-registration\nI greatly admire the efforts of the team at the Center for Open Science in bringing preregistration and registered reports into widespread scientific discussion and making them a much more common practice. There is no question that drawing clearer, brighter lines between confirmatory and exploratory analyses improves the quality of scientific inference and mitigates questionable research practices.\nThat said, I get the biggest and hardest push-back from colleagues about preregistration when discussing open science practices. One reason is that many people find the process of pregistration difficult, frustrating, and onerous. Yes, there are lots of templates to choose from, and yes, many of the details are already in our IRB protocols or grant proposals. But even so, the benefits of pre-registration seem small relative to the high costs, especially to skeptics.\nFor these reasons, and innate pragmatism, I spend more of my energy talking-up data sharing. Data are more interesting to me personally and probably more useful in evaluating the impact and importance of a given piece of work than a detailed preregistration plan. One of my graduate school mentors told me that he reads a paper’s methods and results first, and only after that decides whether to read the introduction and conclusion. Frankly, if the data aren’t interesting or the effects clear, I don’t care that much what the authors predicted or how they tortured the data. And by extension, if the effect is strong, it’s unlikely to matter much whether the authors predicted it or not. Further, I’ve found no convincing retort to the skeptics who ask me why I think someone actually followed their preregistered procedure. In short, I think that most studies on human participants are under-powered and that we need to vastly increase the quantity of shared data in order to address problems of estimating true effect size distributions. While I may not really know whether a researcher followed the protocol reported in a manuscript or in their preregistration, I can evaluate the size of the reported effect and hopefully combine it with other datasets…if the data are shared. When push comes to shove, I’d rather authors commit to open data sharing and carry through on their commitments than encourage people to preregister but have them stop short of sharing.\nSo, while I’m completely happy endorsing the virtues of preregistration, I’m going to keep asking authors of papers I review, most of which are not preregistered, to share their data. That’s because I think data, materials, and analysis code sharing is ultimately more important to advancing discovery than preregistration. And ‘learn more faster’ is not only Databrary’s tagline, is my personal motivation for adopting open science practices. That ultimate goal can get lost in the sometimes devilish discussions about specific details."

It’s a contest weekend, after all, so even the W6LVP loop mounted indoors should hear something. And it sure did.\nWhat KE9SDR has done with the user interface is really impressive. The 1500 is a software defined radio (SDR), so must be controlled by a PC. There are many controls, but most of the critical ones for an experienced operator are simple keyboard presses. To change frequency up or down, press one set of keys. To make a larger frequency jump, press another pair. To change the receive filter width, press another pair. To change the automatic gain control (AGC) threshold–a key adjustment for reducing noise on the FlexRadio platform–press another pair of keys. Change band segments or bands, you guessed it.\nYou do need a mouse or trackpad to navigate to different parts of the window, but it is largely a keyboard-centered experience. And it’s really, really great. Better than the SmartSDR program for Windows and the SmartSDR program for MacOS and iOS that I use on my Flex 6400. And that’s saying a lot. I really like the iOS SmartSDR app.\nI think my friend Karen Adolph who designed the Datavyu video coding program specifically to minimize mouse use and maximize the use of keyboard commands would really like it, even if she doesn’t see the point of ham radio. We all need good UI even if we don’t always appreciate it. PowerSDR is clearly a labor of (very thoughtful) love. Thanks KE9NS.\nNow, if we could just get FlexRadio to bring the 1500 back.

    "text": "My dad died Thanksgiving night.\nMy cousins hosted the Thanksgiving feast, as they have so graciously and generously done for many years. Dad ate more than usual; he hasn’t had much of an appetite for some time. But he had a great time talking with my cousins and enjoying the warmth of a loving extended family.\nLater that night, at home with my mom, what he thought were GI symptoms turned out to be something else. And his weakened heart just quit. My mom performed the chest compressions the 911 dispatcher recommended. But she thinks he had gone long before the responders arrived.\nWhen asked to produce documentation that my dad had indeed signed a do not resuscitate request, she did so surprisingly easily for the circumstances…because my dad had left it in a place she could easily find. And that was my dad.\nMichelle and I had hoped he’d make it to Christmas. We’re visiting then. But he did not. And he did not get to meet his great-grandson.\nBut he lived a full and rich life. His last days were joyful. His very last day was spent in gratitude. And his last moments were spent at home.\nWe are all living on borrowed time. I do not know the creditor. Nor can I muster any suitable collateral to guarantee the loan. I want more than I have, but will take what I am given. May all our debts be graciously forgiven."

    "text": "I understand why Republican partisans want to confuse the public. But this is crystal clear.\nNo candidate for elected office in the United States should ever seek or receive help from foreign countries to win an election. Not ever. Period.\nIn taking office, a president pledges (or affirms) to “preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution.” Senators and Congressional Representatives pledge (or affirm) to “support and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic…”\nMr. Trump has now at least twice asked for help from a foreign power to gain political advantage over an opponent, once as a candidate, and at least once as president. The asking itself is unmistakably, incontrovertibly, and indefensibly wrong.\nSeeking foreign interference subverts the integrity of our elections, undermines the Constitution, and violates the presidential oath of office.\nA president must uphold the rule of law not advance the law of rulers. He is unfit. He must be impeached and removed from office. Failing to do so represents a violation of the oath of office taken by Senators and Representatives alike to “defend the Constitution against all enemies, foreign and domestic.”\nThere is no fog here, just strategically and cynically blown smoke."

It was great fun, and we plan to keep practicing and plan to meet-up again next week.\nRe-learning Morse code has reinforced several things for me.

    "text": "I wish it were otherwise, but I agree with Andrew Sullivan. Regardless of what the Mueller report holds, Trump has severely damaged the country and made our Nation weaker, not stronger.\nRegretably, Mr. Trump has been exactly the sort of president many of us feared he would be. And his supporters, Donocrat and Trumpublican alike, actually like it that way. That is the grim reality that his opponents must face. His bombast and bluster and poutiness and pettiness appeal to large numbers of Americans. This charlatan’s charlatan seems authentic to them in ways that other more competent and legitimate leaders do not. Absent a meaningful challenge from within his own party, nowhere evident, that sentiment is unlikely to change.\nI am reminded of this essay in the New York Times published before the dust of the 2016 election had truly settled. Zingales argues that opponents of Italy’s Trump-like prime minister, Silvio Berlusconi, learned the hard way that the only way to defeat a larger-than-life autocrat is to sweat the details.\n\nThe Italian experience provides a blueprint for how to defeat Mr. Trump. Only two men in Italy have won an electoral competition against Mr. Berlusconi: Romano Prodi and the current prime minister, Matteo Renzi (albeit only in a 2014 European election). Both of them treated Mr. Berlusconi as an ordinary opponent. They focused on the issues, not on his character.\n\nThe deficit has exploded, the border is insecure, North Korea remains a mortal threat to its neighbors, America’s reputation, power, and influence have declined, the rule of law has been weakened, and we have magnified the already challenges we must inevitably face in responding to climate change. Trump has not, will not, and cannot make America great. And his supporters have not, will not, and cannot acknowledge it.\nBut as John Adams said, “Facts are stubborn things; and whatever may be our wishes, our inclinations, or the dictates of our passions, they cannot alter the state of facts and evidence.” And it is the facts and evidence of Trump’s incompetence we must highlight, relentlessly and fearlessly, to defeat him."

    "section": "Election 2023 and beyond",
    "text": "Election 2023 and beyond\nAll of us shape the future through our actions large and small. One way to shape the future of public policy is to vote. This article provides information about the voting process that may be useful to long-time and first-time voters alike. It is drawn from my nearly 20 years of experience as an election official here in the Highlands neighborhood.\nThe 2023 General Election will be held on Tuesday, November 7, 2023. There are no Senate or Congressional races on the ballot, but there are statewide races, a full slate of county-wide races, and races for State College Borough Council and the State College Area School Board being contested. Polls open at 7:00 am and close at 8:00 pm. All voters who are in-line at 8:00 pm are permitted to vote. The latter provision is especially important during presidential elections when voter turn-out is at its highest and lines can be long.\nVoting in Pennsylania is strictly by precinct, and precincts are explicit geographic areas. With some very limited exceptions, you must vote in the precinct where you are registered. This poses no challenge for long-time voters unless their polling place location changes, but can cause confusion for occasional voters–those who vote only in presidential elections, for example–or new voters. So, if you plan to vote in-person, you must go to the precinct where you are registered. As this (https://centrecountypa.gov/DocumentCenter/View/15033/State-College-Precinct-Map-11x17_May-2023?bidId=) shows, Highlands residents vote in Precincts 23, 26, 29, 30, and 34. That same site provides information about where voters choosing to vote in-person must go on Election Day. For example, Precincts 26 and 30 vote at the State College Friends Meeting on East Prospect Avenue.\nIf you are new to the Highlands neighborhood or have not voted in some time, you may not remember where you go to vote. Your best bet to confirm your voting location is to visit the site maintained by the Pennsyvlania Department of State (https://www.pavoterservices.pa.gov/Pages/PollingPlaceInfo.aspx). If you have not yet registered to vote, you must do so by October 23, 2023, but it is best to register well in advance of that date by visiting this site (https://www.pavoterservices.pa.gov/pages/VoterRegistrationApplication.aspx). There are a number of get-out-the-vote organizations that also register voters, but it is a good idea to confirm that your voter registration has been processed well in advance of the registration date. I failed to do this myself when I was a college student back in 1984 and found out too late that I was not registered to vote. The Centre County Election Office maintains a useful website (https://centrecountyvotes.gov) where you can confirm that you are registered and in what precinct. The staff are happy to answer any questions (814-355-6703) you can’t find answers to online.\nOur neighborhood includes, and we welcome, non-permanent residents, including undergraduate and graduate students, post docs, and visiting faculty. If you are eligible to vote in Pennsylvania (https://www.vote.pa.gov/Register-to-Vote/Pages/Voter-Registration-Requirements.aspx), you may register and vote here. If you are already registered to vote in another part of Pennsylvania or in another state, you may choose to re-register and vote here in State College, or you may vote absentee in your home PA precinct or state. In this case, you must follow your home jurisdiction’s procedures for requesting and returning an absentee ballot. Some voters are confused by the fact that the same races might be on the ballot here and in the voter’s home precinct, especially state-wide, U.S. Senate, and Presidential races, but the voter must still cast votes in the precinct where they are registered. Again, in Pennsylvania, we vote strictly by precinct. So, voters who are not permanent residents must decide where they want to vote (e.g., back home or here) and then make sure that they are lawfully registered in that jurisdiction.\nAfter you register or re-register, you should receive a voter registration card in the mail. Please keep your voter registration card in a safe place and bring it with you to your polling place. Not only does your voter registration card indicate your precinct, but it serves as one of the acceptable forms of identification that might be required of new or inactive voters. All voters new to a precinct must present an acceptable form of identification–even if they were registered to vote elsewhere for a long time. Some other voters might also be asked to produce identification if the County Election Office has reason to believe that the voter has moved or if the voter has not voted in a number of election cycles.\nThis piece has focused on in-person voting. If you request an absentee or mail-in ballot but do not receive it, please come to the polling place to let your precinct Election Board try to help sort things out. Similarly, if you received your absentee or mail-in ballot materials but decide to vote in-person, bring the complete ballot packet with you to the polling place. Your Election Board will need those materials to issue you an in-person ballot.\nWho is this Election Board I mentioned? Your neighbors. Each precinct has an Election Board that consists of a Judge of Elections, two Inspectors, and a set of Clerks. The Judge of Elections and Inspector are elected positions, but there are often vacancies that must be filled by the County Election Office. In my precinct the vacancies are often filled by some outstanding students from Bellefonte High School. In more than 20 years of living in the Highlands, have served as a Clerk, Inspector, and now Judge of Elections in Precinct 26. Twice a year I get to serve my community while catching up with friends and neighbors on the latest news. It’s a long day, but an immensely satisfying one. We poll-workers are on the front lines of democracy, and it is a privilege and honor to serve. So, please consider joining us. If you are in Precinct 26, email me at rogilmore@mac.com. If you are in other precincts, contact the County Election Office (814-355-6703) and tell them you’d like to be considered.\nAs the saying goes, vote like your future depends on it. See you at the polls."

Don’t just trust me, demand my evidence and critique it. And while you’re at it, show me yours."

    "text": "Scholars who study science as an activity have tried to describe the characteristic norms and counter-norms that govern research activities. In this semester’s PSYCH 490 class, we’ve read Merton (Merton 1973), Mitroff (Mitroff 1974), and a couple of empirical articles (Kardash and Edwards 2012) that focus on how often scientists should versus actually embrace these values. We’ve even created a document that summarizes the entire data processing workflow, from gathering data from our own colleagues to visualizing it.\n\n\n\nVisualization of Survey-02 results from PSYCH 490.009 Fall 2023\n\n\nI’ve struggled a bit to come up with a visualization about our own results This one seems to be the best so far. Perhaps not surprisingly, and in accord with empirical data (Kardash and Edwards 2012), undergraduate trainees rate scientists actual adherence to aspirational norms lower than what those scientists ought to do. Still, the students aren’t completely jaded, so there is hope we can turn this crisis of credibility into an opportunity.\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nKardash, Carolanne M, and Ordene V Edwards. 2012. “Thinking and Behaving Like Scientists: Perceptions of Undergraduate Science Interns and Their Faculty Mentors.” Instructional Science 40 (6): 875–99. https://doi.org/10.1007/s11251-011-9195-0.\n\n\nMerton, Robert K. 1973.

There is also no doubt that some countries, or more precisely, some cultures appear much better equipped than others to confront the challenges of the current moment. Significant parts of American culture are not among the well-equipped.\nObserve, for example, the case of Nebraska, where meatpacking plants have had significant corona virus outbreaks, but companies and public officials have been reluctant to provide information about the extent of the problem (https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2020/05/12/nebraska-coronavirus-case-numbers-meatpacking/?utm_campaign=wp_post_most&utm_medium=email&utm_source=newsletter&wpisrc=nl_most) until pressured to do so by the fear of embarrassment. Can we agree in this bitterly divided nation that all of us are afraid of the very same things – that the virus might harm us or those we care about and that a prolonged quarantine might destroy a way of life we have come to enjoy? I submit to you that until those parts of American culture that vigorously deny their fear can face it squarely – rather than mask it with anger and bravado – we’ll continue to provide the world object lessons in how not to respond.\nFacts, data, evidence, reason, discipline, skepticism, sacrifice, generosity, honor, resolve, and courage.

    "title": "In search of the ethogram",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Psychology is in part, a science of behavior. Mental experience – thoughts and feelings – are also common targets of inquiry.\nI recently went looking for a systematic catalogue of behaviors that should, in theory, constitute the substance of what psychologists and other behavioral scientists study. My goal was to take that catalogue as a starting point for thinking about the relationship between information available for perception and the actions (behaviors) that this information informs. The formal term for this sort of catalog is an ‘ethogram’. Here’s a sample template from the Tree of Life project. Unfortunately, I failed in my quest.\nThere have been attempts to create and openly share animal ethograms like the apparently stalled or inactive ethobank.org site associated with the EthoSource project. The Cognitive Paradigm Ontology and the Cognitive Atlas project attempt to create systematic ontologies (systematic representations of categories and concepts and their relations) of tasks used in experimental psychology. Cognitive psychology tasks clearly require very specific types of behavior from participants. Systematically organizing the nature of these tasks should lead to faster progress in understanding how they relate to one another, and ultimately, how minds and brains actually work. Still, I came up short in finding a comprehensive human ethogram.\nIn other contexts, I’ve called such a thing the behaviorome, partly to suggest that behavior should have a more central place in research grantmaking priorities. The PLAY project is a type of behaviorome effort. We will be creating detailed definitions for specific behaviors that our infant and adult participants produce in a small set of behavioral domains, but it will not be comprehensive by any means. For now, I’m stuck with trying to assemble my own.\nOne approach to an ethogram for humans could focus on biologically essential behavioral classes that we share with all other animals: ingestion (food and nutrient seeking), defense (self-protection), and reproduction. Unfortunately, this scheme fail to capture the sets of behaviors studied by the majority of psychologists. Adding in a class of communicative and affiliative behaviors helps. But even this augmented classification describes the functional purposes of behavior, not the behaviors themselves. For example, locomotor behavior, moving toward or away from some target, occurs in food seeking, predator avoidance, mate seeking, and social (affiliative) contexts.\nAnother way to ask the question is to observe whether physical activities that humans do for pleasure and watch others for entertainment (sports) have some latent structure we might exploit. Here, we assume that if large groups of humans engage in an activity or pay to watch others engage in it, the skills involved must be especially demanding. Indeed, professional sports represent some of humankind’s most skilled (and highly paid) actors. And while I’m still looking for a comprehensive catalog of sport types, this table shows that most of them fall into a small set of categories when focusing on the core actions that define success.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCategory\nSports\n\n\n\n\naiming\nbasketball, baseball, football (passing & kicking), hocky, soccer, bowling, tennis, golf, pool/billiards, archery, …\n\n\nsteering\nslalom skiing, motorsports\n\n\nperforming\ngymnastics, diving, synchronized swimming, figure skating, …\n\n\nracing\nrunning, motorsports, speed skating, swimming, cycling, paddling\n\n\nfighting\nboxing, wrestling, …\n\n\nfeats of strength\nweightlifting\n\n\n\nYou may disagree with my categorization, but I hope you’ll agree that there are many similarities in the sorts of actions we find entertaining to watch.\nAnother approach to an ethogram starts with the actions that computer vision researchers find are important to extract from video. Google’s Atomic Visual Action (AVA) dataset (https://research.google.com/ava/) involves three classes of movements, person movement, object interaction, person interaction, and has exemplars with 81 specific actions that fit into these categories. Some examples of specific behaviors tagged in the AVA dataset are crawl, dance, jump/leap, lift, open, press, hug, kiss, and listen to.\nMaybe some combination of these approaches is as good a start as any. After all, if behavioral biologists don’t seem to agree about what constitutes behavior, it’s not that surprising that psychologists haven’t yet created our own list. We do need a list like this, though, don’t you think?"

    "text": "Today I rode my bicycle to our public library (an American innovation), and walked around the corner to an Indian restaurant that is owned and operated by people of Latin American heritage. While I enjoyed a quiet lunch, diners of all ages and multiple backgrounds did the same. There was a head-scarf-wearing mother who works at the restaurant attending to her infant, a separate group of head-scarf-wearing people, people in wheelchairs, people with long hair and short, dark skin and light. This panorama of humanity found common purpose in our peaceful enjoyment of food from one of the world’s great civilizations. And we like to joke that State College is “centrally isolated.”\nWhat makes America great (to me) is exactly, precisely this diversity. What makes America great is that from our very founding, we have attempted to forge a one from the many. Did you know that E Pluribus Unum, “out of many, one”, was considered our de facto motto until the 1950’s when “In God We Trust” was adopted as the official one? I didn’t. And I think that was a mistake, just as I think adding “under God” to the Pledge of Allegiance was a mistake. Atheists and animists comprise the pluribus, too. And somehow I suspect a supreme entity, should one exist, is diminished in no way by a national motto or pledge that fully reflects the diversity of the creation, encompassing believer and unbeliever alike.\nAnd so what makes America great (to me) is this very struggle. Are we one Nation of many, including diverse and discrepant views on religious questions, racial and ethnic backgrounds, languages and cultures, or are we something else, something, well, smaller? I know that loud voices in our land today and among our leaders want to expel the different and shun the diverse, to make us smaller, more homogeneous. And what makes America great (to me) is that these too often hateful and fearful voices also have their place among the threads of the national tapestry.\nBut love it or not, a patchwork, quilt-like tapestry it is, we are, first, foremost, and finally. And that, my friends, is a flag that genuine patriots are most happy to wrap themselves in. Like a burrito."

But working on this project has reinforced the idea that “plotting early and often” or even “plotting first” is a worthwhile goal. If you can generate a meaningful plot for some piece of data, then it’s in a useful form. That’s the idea.\nHere’s an example:\n\n\n\nWalking onset measured via two criteria from https://play-behaviorome.github.io/KoBoToolbox/locomotion-visualizations.html\n\n\nIt shows the relationship between a set of criteria used by the World Health Organization (WHO) to determine when a child begins walking and a stricter set of criteria used by my colleague Karen Adolph in her research on locomotion. You’d hope that these relate to one another closely, and this plot shows that’s the case. It also shows that there aren’t clear sex differences. That might have been known before, but if so, our data bolster the finding.\nHere’s another plot I created today based on the Early Childhood Behavior Questionnaire (ECBQ) very short form:\n\n\n\nParent ratings of child behavior from https://play-behaviorome.github.io/KoBoToolbox/temperament-visualizations.html\n\n\nClearly, I need to do more work on the data dictionary so I can pull in the question parents were actually asked. But it’s satisfying to get this far, especially since not all of the figures look the same:\n\n\n\nParent ratings of child behavior from https://play-behaviorome.github.io/KoBoToolbox/temperament-visualizations.html\n\n\nMoreover, I believe that standard practice when using this measure is to calculate aggregate “scale” scores without visualizing the individual responses. We’ll get to aggregate scales soon, but these individual scores are interesting in their own right."

If you’re curious, you can download the databraryr package from this GitHub repository: https://github.com/databrary/databraryr.\nLike many people in the software world, I’m entirely self-taught. Ok, I took a class in C programming at the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Graduate School in the year before I applied to graduate schools in cognitive neuroscience. But my R package development skills are entirely self-taught. I must thank the incredibly generous geniuses who have gone before me and who share their code and their talents so freely and openly. Without the almost instant availability of these resources, my progress would be much, much slower.\nDevelopers are an opinionated bunch, and there are at least as many styles (fads?) in software development as their are developers. One style that I have started to try to emulate is ‘test-driven development’. In TDD, the idea is that you create tests for how each part of your package should respond given this or that input. If your tests are through enough and correct, your package should work…at least within the boundaries of what you tested.\nFor the latest version of the package (0.1.4), I added a bunch of new tests to evaluate several new functions I’ve added to the package. Let’s just say that getting through my own self-designed test battery was challenging. But as a result, the code is cleaner and less buggy than it would be if I hadn’t gone this route.\nIn the larger sense, TDD is sort of a “plan for the worst” style. I like it because I know it forces me to be more precise and specific than I might otherwise choose to be. Since I’ve been using the databraryapi more often for keeping tabs on what’s going on in the Databrary world, that’s a very good thing.\nIn case you’re curious what the package can do, check this out:\n\ndevtools::install_github(\"databrary/databraryr\")\n\nDownloading GitHub repo databrary/databraryr@HEAD\n\n\n\n── R CMD build ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n* checking for file ‘/private/var/folders/hz/j_rrw69j3pz2xfp4m2jgj__h0000gp/T/RtmpuE9RJI/remotesc05023b4f9ba/databrary-databraryr-2be467f/DESCRIPTION’ ...

DBN focuses on the development of religious and spiritual beliefs, among other topics.\nEarly in my career, I joked that while I’d started my career in cognitive science as a developmental psycholinguist, language was too hard. So, I switched to perception. The DBN meeting reminded me that perception is only the tip of a very big cognitive iceberg.\nIt occurs to me that many advancements in science have stemmed from creative new capacities to see natural phenomena that were hard or even impossible to see at the time they were envisioned. Astronomers had to imagine the Earth’s rotation around its axis, the Moon’s rotation around the Earth, and the Earth’s rotation around the Sun in order to explain the observed movements of the Sun, the Moon, the planets, and the stars. Newton had to imagine that the unseen, but measurable force of gravity applied not just to terrestrial objects but to planets, moons, and stars. Electromagnetism, germ theory, the genetic basis of inheritance all required new ways of envisioning things unseen that were the root causes of things that could be seen and felt. And often, scientists eventually developed tools that made it possible to see the results of these root causes. Just this week, the James Webb Space Telescope released an image of an “Einstein Ring”, an illustration of gravitational lensing predicted by Einstein’s theory of relativity that describes how large masses alter the shape of space-time itself.\n\nSo, really, the development of beliefs about unseen religious figures isn’t categorically different from the emergence of scientific ideas. Human minds equipped with powerful imaginations can’t help but envision unseen causal forces that explain the otherwise inexplicable. And some of those ingenious minds go on to make tools that eventually make visible the previously invisible.\nSo, hats off to the DBN folks for helping me see that atheists have much to learn by thinking about religion and to the JWST team for letting all of us see the warping of space-time itself."

But I never pushed or insisted, and so it never happened.\nThen, as a byproduct of a bunch of reading I’ve been doing about causal modeling and the philosophy of science, I came up with a figure that seems to work on several levels.\n\nThe outer circle represents the world, the next circle the body that is embedded in the world, the next the nervous system embedded in that body (in the world), and the smallest the mind embedded in the brain (in the body in the world). The world, body, and brain are directly measurable in various ways. The mind is not. We infer properties and structures of the mind indirectly, through patterns of brain activity or peripheral physiology or behavior. The focal point of psychology as a science is making inferences about something that cannot be directly measured. This is one reason psychology is harder than physics.\nThe figure has other associations. It is similar to one used to demonstrate that rotational motion in 2 dimensions can evoke the perception of an object in 3 dimensions – something called the stereokinetic depth effect (SKE). It evokes the perception of a cone-like shape protruding up and to the left. And it evokes a weaker perception of a tunnel. I study depth perception and motion perception, so these features make the figure even more appealing.\nFinally, the figure could be viewed as a large letter O, for openness, something I now embrace in all aspects of my scholarship.\nI confess that I was just trying a new way to depict the embedded causal relationships among mind, brain, body, and the environment and found a color scheme I liked. The rest was purely accidental. But I guess invention is like that sometimes.\nI hope you like it."

My health insurance through Penn State covered the full cost.\nThese vaccines should reduce the likelihood that I will catch one of these diseases, or if I do succumb to one of them, reduce the likelihood of serious disease. They are truly modern scientific miracles, and I am immensely grateful to the researchers who develop them, and the systems that deploy them at-scale.\nBeyond the benefits to me, these vaccines benefit others. I’ve lost unvaccinated friends to COVID, and there is overwhelming evidence that the vaccines reduce the most severe disease. By getting vaccinated, I reduce the chance that I will convey these highly communicable diseases to others. So, keeping my vaccination status current is one among many sacrifices I gladly choose to make for my family, my friends, and my community.\nI wish that CVS gave out “I’m vaxxed” stickers like the “I voted” stickers we give out at my polling place. Rest assured, I’ll be sporting one of the latter on November 7. And of course, I’ll be more relaxed interacting with the voting public knowing that I’m vaxxed to the maxx."

We need such a holiday to reconcile the past with our common hopes for a better future, to ‘bind up the Nation’s wounds’, as Lincoln suggested in his second inaugural address. I suggest we make April 9 that day.\nLee surrendered to Grant on April 9, 1865 in Appomattox Court House, Virginia, a month after Lincoln’s second inaugural. This ended the military portion of the Civil War, the bloodiest conflict in American history. But in a very real sense, the conflict never truly ended. It simply shifted to other battlefields, several of which rage on today.\nI suggest that the American project is stronger when we, the people, view our history openly and honestly, with the courage to acknowledge our shortcomings. Indeed, lacking such an honest accounting, our sense of pride may appear prideful or worse, willfully ignorant of the price so many have paid for this progress.\nWhere and how has America fallen short? My list may differ from yours, but here are some suggestions: Our genocide of Native Americans, our history of slavery, our treatment of any number of immigrant groups, the long delay in granting women suffrage, the Japanese internment, the ways American white supremacists inspired the Nazis, the interminable war on terror no one seems willing to end, and our failures to confront and address climate change.\nA truly great and powerful nation can muster the courage to face its own flaws and to hold itself account. Indeed, lacking that courage, how can any people aspire to righteousness or assume the responsibilities of leadership?\nLike the Jews, who atone for sin on Yom Kippur by seeking forgiveness from one another before facing judgment from the almighty, let us set aside April 9 for a national day of reflection and reconciliation. Let us find strength in examining our weakness. And let such a day form a more perfect union among us that we may secure the blessings of liberty, as we the people have ordained in our Constitution, for all posterity."

Peace-loving people of all faiths and no faith at all must work tirelessly to end the violence there.\nAnd, the deliberate murder of more than 1,400 people, mostly Jews, by Hamas is a crime against humanity. It cannot be excused and must not be diminished.\nTo call the war in Gaza genocide is deeply, profoundly wrong. The term genocide did not exist until it was invented in 1944 by a Polish Jew specifically to describe the systematic murder of Jews by the Nazis. The 10/7 attack was the largest killing of Jews since the Holocaust, and it was entirely in keeping with the mission of Hamas, as stated in its charter. That charter specifically calls for genocidal actions: The killing of Jews and the destruction of Israel. It is no irony that some advocates for Palestinians want to ignore these facts about Hamas and blur the meaning of genocide.\nThis department and this institution exist to support the free and civil exchange of ideas about controversial topics, including this one. But it is wrong for the department and institution to take sides in a dispute of this magnitude and complexity. And it is deeply insensitive to many Jewish faculty, staff, and students who are still grieving the terrible events of 10/7 and the violence that has ensued since."

This year was no exception.\nUnlike two years ago, when one of the more senior hams had to shove the microphone and headphones into my hands to get me to jump into the chair, this year I happily jumped into the fray whenever the opportunity arose.

And the answer is, like so many other things, you just have to try. So, my unsolicited advice to hams like me who are a little mic shy, or maybe intimidated by CW?\nJust do it.

This means that with low power, modest antennas, and poor propagation conditions, hams can have actual conversations with one another.\nThis represents a significant departure from FT8 where callsigns, grid squares, and signal reports are about all that get exchanged. I’ve played around with JT8, too, but the appeal seems limited to me. Yes, my elmer got DXCC on FT8 in less than a month, and yes, I’m still working my way there on SSB. But, JS8Call suits my interests more directly. The developer, a guy named Jordan Scherer is an open source guru and all around righteous ham, and he has a plan about where this sort of tool might go.

    "text": "The Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute for Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) has requested input on a draft strategic plan for 2020-2024.\nNICHD supports Databrary and PLAY, and it has supported my habituation modeling work in the past. The following is a draft response my colleagues and I are working on.\n\nDear Dr. Bianchi:\nThank you for the opportunity to respond to the NICHD Strategic Plan for Fiscal Years 2020-2024. We write as Principal Investigators of the Play & Learning Across a Year (PLAY) project (R01HD094830), a 65-researcher-strong video-based study of natural infant/mother behavior, funded by NICHD, NIMH, OBSSSR, and the Office of the Director. Our recommendation is simple: We urge you and your colleagues to incorporate a clear vision for behavioral research in the plan’s research themes and goals to underscore the pivotal importance of behavior and experience in child development.\nBehavior is the linchpin of the most vexing problems in public health, and a better understanding of behavior is fundamental to achieving positive health outcomes, from prenatal development throughout adulthood. Behavior contributes to the progression or prevention of disease, defines a disorder or marks recovery, and provides mechanisms for therapeutic intervention. The study of child health and human development magnifies this importance. According to the CDC, two of the three leading causes of death among children aged 1-4 (accidents and assault/homicide) and children aged 5- 14 (accidents and suicide) involve behavior, among other factors. One child in six has a developmental disability. The most common developmental disabilities—autism spectrum disorder (ASD), attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and sensory impairments—substantially impact behaviors across the lifespan, and often the most effective interventions are behavioral. Virtually every problem in children, families, and society—substance use, school violence, school dropout, ethnic disparities, emotional dysregulation, racism and discrimination, and more—can be traced to behaviors and experiences in childhood. Moreover, the growing field of epigenetics reveals that genetics data alone provide limited insights about developmental outcomes without critical information about early experiences, behaviors, and environments.\nIn the context of the NICHD 2020-2024 Strategic plan, our specific recommendations are as follows. In Research Theme #1—understanding early human development—we ask that you expand the focus beyond genetic and cellular levels of analysis and incorporate maternal and fetal behavior as central phenomena that need to be studied and understood. Similarly, regarding Research Theme #2—setting the stage for a healthy pregnancy—we ask that you expand the focus to include maternal and other caregiver behaviors, including paternal behaviors, that may reduce or elevate risk. Research Theme #4—identifying sensitive time periods to optimize health interventions—highlights the role of behavior. However, the plan implies that we have sufficient knowledge about the varied trajectories of typical development to productively intervene in atypical development. This may be true in a limited set of domains, but is not broadly true in our experience. Much more research about behavioral development is needed. Our suggestion about Research Theme #5—Improving health during the transition from adolescence to adulthood—is to broaden the lens to include research on childhood behaviors observed in a variety of settings that serve as precursors to risk in adolescence.\nWe wish to emphasize that many standardized laboratory tasks or parent-report questionnaire instruments thought to reliably reflect the “phenotype,” fail to capture vital dimensions of infant, child, adolescent, and parent behavior that occur in natural settings. Indeed, this gap motivates our focus on video in the PLAY project. Natural behavior in home, school, and clinical settings can be reliably and informatively captured and analyzed using video. And we have shown that video can be securely and ethically shared using tools for video informatics (Databrary and Datavyu) and policies for restricted data sharing with explicit consent that we have developed and shared with the research community thanks to NICHD support (U01HD076595).\nThe PLAY project capitalizes on these advances in an effort to capture, analyze, and openly share data about the building blocks of infant and maternal behavior combining video with other data sources. PLAY is motivated in part by the belief that the hard-won knowledge gleaned from public funding for the genome, proteome, metabolome, and connectome initiatives will have substantially greater impact on child and maternal health outcomes when combined with insights from a corresponding “behaviorome.” As a “behaviorome”-like research effort, PLAY aims to accelerate the pace of discovery in basic and applied developmental science. NICHD has a strong track record of funding research on infant and child behavior. Given the essential role of behavior in maternal, child, and adolescent health, we urge NICHD to build upon this tradition by giving the study of behavior substantially greater emphasis and visibility in the 2020-2024 strategic plan and beyond.\nYours truly,\nKaren Adolph, Professor of Psychology and Neural Science, New York University\nRick O. Gilmore, Associate Professor of Psychology, The Pennsylvania State University\nCatherine Tamis-LeMonda, Professor of Applied Psychology, New York University"

    "text": "I gave a talk last week to our developmental area faculty, grads, and postdocs. One attendee noted that many of the factors that make research less open stem from institutional practices. They went on to ask what that observation means for early career researchers (ECRs).\nThis seemed like an excellent question for the group of experts who subscribe to the Journal Editors’ Discussion Interface (JEDI) project on which I serve as a member of the steering committee and one of the founding sponsors via Databrary. So, I posed the question there. And true to form, I got some very good answers and helpful hints.\nFor example, the U.K. Research Integrity Office had prepared this infographic:\n\n\n\nhttps://ukrio.org/wp-content/uploads/Infographic_ImprovingResearchCulture_Responsibilities-of-a-PGR-student.pdf\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThe UKRIO has other infographics available here:\nhttps://ukrio.org/resources/?res_topic=&res_tag=Infographic&res_srch=\n\n\nMorton Ann Gernsbacher and colleagues had prepared this one-pager as part of a meeting several years ago:\n\nAnd one of the respondents had this advice:\n\nOne way to do that would be to start a ReproducibiliTea journal club (https://www.reproducibilitea.org), with the hope of creating community among the early-career researchers as they learn about and pursue Open Science practices. This could in turn foster changes in their department, such as inclusion in the graduate research training curriculum or the norming of practices like open data sharing, code review and the like. Here’s an introductory reading list I created that a new club can follow through to get the overall picture of the Open Science movement: https://osf.io/qxbcs.\nI would also highly recommend Charlotte Pennington’s recent book: A Student’s Guide to Open Science: Using the Replication Crisis to Reform Psychology. https://www.mheducation.co.uk/a-student-s-guide-to-open-science-using-the-replication-crisis-to-reform-psychology-9780335251162-emea-group. It is directly focused on the early-career researcher and gives an overview, advice on how to pursue and adopt open science practices and more.\n\nI myself have a copy of the Pennington book on-order and will say more when I’ve had a look.\nSo, the bottom line is this: Not only is the JEDI community awesome, but there are lots of good sources of information for ECRs. Maybe we need a separate line of communication with old dogs like me who have a harder time learning new tricks.\n\n\n\nhttps://www.stevenjosephauthor.com/teaching-the-old-dog-new-tricks-crankatsuris/\n\n\nIt would be good to push-back against the claim that a closed research culture will only change one funeral at a time."

So, I took the survey project as an opportunity to explore how a powerful R package called bookdown could help make the process more transparent and reproducible. The github repository is here: https://github.com/penn-state-open-science/survey-fall-2022, but a more visually attractive introduction can be found in the rendered site: https://penn-state-open-science.github.io/survey-fall-2022/index.html and especially the data visualizations https://penn-state-open-science.github.io/survey-fall-2022/data-visualization.html.\n\n\n\nTime series of responses to open science survey\n\n\nThe site is somewhat unique in capturing the information we filed with the Penn State IRB prior to conducting the study. Also novel is that the site incorporates code that downloads and cleans the survey data and goes on to show some simple visualizations of it. So, the process of updating the report as new responses come in is extremely simple.\nThere are still tweaks to be made. For one thing, we did not control the department or unit that respondents could report. So, there is some manual cleaning to do when a respondent uses an idiosyncratic name for their unit. Also, I’m still trying out different ways to authenticate to Google–the survey is a Google Form.\nBut all-in-all, the site not only shares important details about our project that are often left unshared, but the site is a living document about the state of our research. It may not be the intended use of the bookdown package, nor make the most interesting reading, but it serves exactly the purpose we sought to achieve with the survey and hope to achieve with our incipient center."

    "text": "Weak Signal Propagation Reporter (WSPR) spots on 20m during the 2024-04-08 eclipse\n\n\nI ran my Flex 6400 at low power (5 W) to generate propagation data for the HamSCI project during the 2024-04-08 total eclipse. The WSJT-X program generated the signals. With the SmartSDR iOS and MacOS apps and Google Remote Desktop, I was able to monitor the station and control it remotely.\nThe radio telescope did not get built in time. Nor did I participate in the Solar Eclipse QSO Party.\nIt’s fun to see just how far a decent antenna–my end-fed half-wave (EFHW)–got out with only 5 W. And I’ll look forward to the report about how the eclipse affected the ionosphere.\nAs the website itself claims, wspr.rocks!"

    "section": "",
    "text": "My department’s clinical area invited me to present in PSY 543, Clinical Research Methods on open science. I gratefully accepted. We have a strong clinical program, and I enjoy engaging with the students. Today was no exception.\nToday was exceptional, however, in that all seven students said “Yes, a significant crisis” when asked if there is a reproducibility crisis in science, a question asked by a 2016 Nature survey I like to use as a starting point for a conversation on these topics. Whether that’s good or bad depends on your point of view, I suppose. Of course, I agree with the endorsement, and think that recognizing a problem is the first essential step to devising solutions.\nLess notable, but no less fun was a successful experiment with a new Reveal.js trick (multiplex feature) that lets the audience watch the slides advance as I advance them."
