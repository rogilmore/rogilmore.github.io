    <div class="article-content">
      <p>In my last post, I sketched out my workflow for using <a href="https://www.rstudio.com/">RStudio&rsquo;s</a> RMarkdown package to make HTML-based slides that I serve via GitHub and the <a href="http://rawgit.com">RawGit</a> service. I&rsquo;m still a fan, but there is trouble in paradise. Or, I should say that it&rsquo;s not yet paradise. So, in this post, I&rsquo;ll describe some of my complaints. My mom always used to chide me &ldquo;if you don&rsquo;t have something nice to say, don&rsquo;t talk.&rdquo; So, I&rsquo;m hoping she reads the first post and skips this one.</p>

<p>The biggest challenge is that many of the papers I&rsquo;d like to link to are behind pay walls. So, if I decide to link directly to a journal article that supports some particular claim, I&rsquo;m never sure whether the article will actually load in the browser. Penn State has agreements with most of the major publishers I want to link to. So, as a faculty member I&rsquo;m usually able to view an online version of a particular paper if I access it directly or via a link from <a href="http://scholar.google.com">Google Scholar</a>. I know that to show me a given article, there&rsquo;s a whole lot of communication going on behind the scenes that&rsquo;s usually hidden from my view. What this means though is that if I put a URL inside an HTML <code>&lt;iframe&gt;</code>  or a direct Markdown-formatted link like <code>&lt;http://www.nature.com&gt;</code>, there&rsquo;s a better than even chance the resource won&rsquo;t load in my slide. That&rsquo;s true even when I am presenting from a machine that is securely authenticated to the PSU wifi service. So, to borrow a phrase, it should &ldquo;just work&rdquo;, but it doesn&rsquo;t.</p>

<p>The failure to load problem is especially acute if I try to link directly to a data figure. I used to take screen shots of data figures, but that turns out to be a huge file management hassle. I&rsquo;d rather link directly to the source. But, it&rsquo;s not straightforward to do so. Finding a figure&rsquo;s URL is not always easy although I&rsquo;ve gotten pretty good at it. Some journals, however, don&rsquo;t actually serve articles with images and text as separate HTML resources. That means I can&rsquo;t link directly to a figure at all.</p>

<p>In my humble opinion, <strong>all</strong> figures, tables, the reference list, and data from a published source should have distinct, unique URIs. Even better, I would like journals to take a page out of YouTube&rsquo;s book and provide HTML that can be cut and pasted into a document. This would embed the resource right in the document. Better still would be incorporating something that Wikipedia offers on some images &ndash; HTML code that both links to a figure and provides human-readable citation text. Imagine being able to right click and have HTML code like that copied right to your clipboard.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;d paste that into an RMarkdown document, and think I&rsquo;d gone to open science heaven. Or something.</p>
