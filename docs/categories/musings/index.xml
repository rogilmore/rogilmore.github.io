      <description>Just before the curtain, I got the first hint. That was not a hay fever sneeze. The pharmacy was still open when I got to Euston Station after the show. I stocked up on cold remedies and went to check the departure track for the overnight to Edinburgh. Cancelled, the board said. I joined the queue at the customer service window. I could rebook on the first morning departure, but I&amp;rsquo;d miss my bus to the Western Highlands.</description>

      <description>My wife and I watched Amir Bar-Lev&amp;rsquo;s documentary, &amp;ldquo;Happy Valley&amp;rdquo; over the weekend. Our mutual reaction at the end of the movie was to note what a sad, sad story it tells. It was a familiar story, one we lived through. And, while much of the material was familiar, some of it was not.
We live close to campus &amp;ndash; on game day, we can hear the stadium roar when the Nittany Lions score.</description>
