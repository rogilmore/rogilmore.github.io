      <description>My wife and I watched Amir Bar-Lev&amp;rsquo;s documentary, &amp;ldquo;Happy Valley&amp;rdquo; over the weekend. Our mutual reaction at the end of the movie was to note what a sad, sad story it tells. It was a familiar story, one we lived through. And, while much of the material was familiar, some of it was not.
We live close to campus &amp;ndash; on game day, we can hear the stadium roar when the Nittany Lions score.</description>
